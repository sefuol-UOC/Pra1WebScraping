Pricing the COVID-19 Vaccine: A Mathematical Approach";(Submitted on 29 Dec 2020);Susan Martonosi;Banafsheh Behzad;Kayla Cummings;;;"According to the World Health Organization, development of the COVID-19vaccine is occurring in record time. Administration of the vaccine has startedthe same year as the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The United Nationsemphasized the importance of providing COVID-19 vaccines as ""a global publicgood"", which is accessible and affordable world-wide. Pricing the COVID-19vaccines is a controversial topic. We use optimization and game theoreticapproaches to model the COVID-19 U.S. vaccine market as a duopoly with twomanufacturers Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. The results suggest that even in thecontext of very high production and distribution costs, the government cannegotiate prices with the manufacturers to keep public sector prices as low aspossible while meeting demand and ensuring each manufacturer earns a targetprofit. Furthermore, these prices are consistent with those currently predictedin the media.";/abs/2101.03234

SARS-Cov-2 RNA Sequence Classification Based on Territory Information";(Submitted on 9 Jan 2021);Jingwei Liu;;;;;"CovID-19 genetics analysis is critical to determine virus type,virus variantand evaluate vaccines. In this paper, SARS-Cov-2 RNA sequence analysis relativeto region or territory is investigated. A uniform framework of sequence SVMmodel with various genetics length from short to long and mixed-bases isdeveloped by projecting SARS-Cov-2 RNA sequence to different dimensional space,then scoring it according to the output probability of pre-trained SVM modelsto explore the territory or origin information of SARS-Cov-2. Different samplesize ratio of training set and test set is also discussed in the data analysis.Two SARS-Cov-2 RNA classification tasks are constructed based on GISAIDdatabase, one is for mainland, Hongkong and Taiwan of China, and the other is a6-class classification task (Africa, Asia, Europe, North American, SouthAmerican\& Central American, Ocean) of 7 continents. For 3-class classificationof China, the Top-1 accuracy rate can reach 82.45\% (train 60\%, test=40\%);For 2-class classification of China, the Top-1 accuracy rate can reach 97.35\%(train 80\%, test 20\%); For 6-class classification task of world, when theratio of training set and test set is 20\% : 80\% , the Top-1 accuracy rate canachieve 30.30\%.

Impact of Interventional Policies Including Vaccine on Covid-19  Propagation and Socio-Economic Factors";(Submitted on 11 Jan 2021);Haonan Wu;Rajarshi Banerjee;Indhumathi Venkatachalam;Daniel Percy-Hughes;Praveen Chougale;"A novel coronavirus disease has emerged (later named COVID-19) and caused theworld to enter a new reality, with many direct and indirect factors influencingit. Some are human-controllable (e.g. interventional policies, mobility and thevaccine); some are not (e.g. the weather). We have sought to test how a changein these human-controllable factors might influence two measures: the number ofdaily cases against economic impact. If applied at the right level and withup-to-date data to measure, policymakers would be able to make targetedinterventions and measure their cost. This study aims to provide a predictiveanalytics framework to model, predict and simulate COVID-19 propagation and thesocio-economic impact of interventions intended to reduce the spread of thedisease such as policy and/or vaccine. It allows policymakers, governmentrepresentatives and business leaders to make better-informed decisions aboutthe potential effect of various interventions with forward-looking views viascenario planning. We have leveraged a recently launched open-source COVID-19big data platform and used published research to find potentially relevantvariables (features) and leveraged in-depth data quality checks and analyticsfor feature selection and predictions. An advanced machine learning pipelinehas been developed armed with a self-evolving model, deployed on a modernmachine learning architecture. It has high accuracy for trend prediction(back-tested with r-squared) and is augmented with interpretability for deeperinsights.";/abs/2101.03944

Here, an agent-basedmodeling platform is proposed to simulate the spreading of COVID-19 in smalltowns and cities, with a single-individual resolution. The platform isvalidated on real data from New Rochelle, NY -- one of the first outbreaksregistered in the United States. Supported by expert knowledge and informed byreported data, the model incorporates detailed elements of the spreading withina statistically realistic population. Along with pertinent functionality suchas testing, treatment, and vaccination options, the model accounts for theburden of other illnesses with symptoms similar to COVID-19. Unique to themodel is the possibility to explore different testing approaches -- inhospitals or drive-through facilities -- and vaccination strategies that couldprioritize vulnerable groups. Decision making by public authorities couldbenefit from the model, for its fine-grain resolution, open-source nature, andwide range of features.";/abs/2101.05171

Characterizing Discourse about COVID-19 Vaccines: A Reddit Version of  the Pandemic Story";(Submitted on 15 Jan 2021);Wei Wu;Hanjia Lyu;Jiebo Luo;;;"It has been one year since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goodnews is that vaccines developed by several manufacturers are being activelydistributed worldwide. However, as more and more vaccines become available tothe public, various concerns related to vaccines become the primary barriersthat may hinder the public from getting vaccinated. Considering thecomplexities of these concerns and their potential hazards, this study aims tooffer a clear understanding about different population groups' underlyingconcerns when they talk about COVID-19 vaccines, particular those active onReddit. The goal is achieved by applying LDA and LIWC to characterizing thepertaining discourse with insights generated through a combination ofquantitative and qualitative comparisons. Findings include: 1) during thepandemic, the proportion of Reddit comments predominated by conspiracy theoriesoutweighed that of any other topics; 2) each subreddit has its own user bases,so information posted in one subreddit may not reach those from othersubreddits; 3) since users' concerns vary across time and subreddits,communication strategies must be adjusted according to specific needs.

A state of uncertainty related to what has become known as SARS-CoV-2has since fueled conspiracy narratives on social media about the origin,transmission and medical treatment of and vaccination against the resultingdisease, COVID-19. Using social media intelligence to monitor and understandthe proliferation of conspiracy narratives is one way to analyze thedistribution of misinformation on the pandemic. We analyzed more than 9.5MGerman language tweets about COVID-19. The results show that only about 0.6% ofall those tweets deal with conspiracy theory narratives. We also found that thepolitical orientation of users correlates with the volume of content userscontribute to the dissemination of conspiracy narratives, implying thatpartisan communicators have a higher motivation to take part in conspiratorialdiscussions on Twitter. Finally, we showed that contrary to other studies,automated accounts do not significantly influence the spread of misinformationin the German speaking Twitter sphere.

Effects of Population Co-location Reduction on Cross-county Transmission  Risk of COVID-19 in the United States";(Submitted on 1 Jun 2020);Chao Fan;Sanghyeon Lee;Yang Yang;Bora Oztekin;Qingchun Li;The rapid spread of COVID-19 in the United States has imposed a major threatto public health, the real economy, and human well-being. With the absence ofeffective vaccines, the preventive actions of social distancing and travelreduction are recognized as essential non-pharmacologic approaches to controlthe spread of COVID-19. Prior studies demonstrated that human movement andmobility drove the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 in China. Little isknown, however, about the patterns and effects of co-location reduction oncross-county transmission risk of COVID-19. This study utilizes Facebookco-location data for all counties in the United States from March to early May2020. The analysis examines the synchronicity and time lag between travelreduction and pandemic growth trajectory to evaluate the efficacy of socialdistancing in ceasing the population co-location probabilities, andsubsequently the growth in weekly new cases. The results show that themitigation effects of co-location reduction appear in the growth of weekly newcases with one week of delay. Furthermore, significant segregation is foundamong different county groups which are categorized based on numbers of cases.The results suggest that within-group co-location probabilities remain stable,and social distancing policies primarily resulted in reduced cross-groupco-location probabilities (due to travel reduction from counties with largenumber of cases to counties with low numbers of cases). These findings couldhave important practical implications for local governments to inform theirintervention measures for monitoring and reducing the spread of COVID-19, aswell as for adoption in future pandemics. Public policy, economic forecasting,and epidemic modeling need to account for population co-location patterns inevaluating transmission risk of COVID-19 across counties.;/abs/2006.01054

Repurposing drugs for COVID-19 based on transcriptional response of host  cells to SARS-CoV-2";(Submitted on 1 Jun 2020 (;Fuhai Li;Andrew P. Michelson;Randi Foraker;Ming Zhan;Philip R.O. Payne;The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected over 10 millionpeople globally with a relatively high mortality rate. There are manytherapeutics undergoing clinical trials, but there is no effective vaccine ortherapy for treatment thus far. After affected by the Severe Acute RespiratorySyndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), molecular signaling of host cells playscritical roles during the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is significant toidentify the involved molecular signaling pathways within the host cells, anddrugs targeting these molecular signaling pathways could be potentiallyeffective for COVID-19 treatment. In this study, we aimed to identify thesepotential molecular signaling pathways, and repurpose existing drugs as apotentially effective treatment of COVID-19 to facilitate the therapeuticdiscovery, based on the transcriptional response of host cells. We firstidentified dysfunctional signaling pathways associated with the infectioncaused SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells through analysis of thealtered gene expression profiles. In addition to the signaling pathwayanalysis, the activated gene ontologies (GOs) and super gene ontologies wereidentified. Signaling pathways and GOs such as MAPK, JNK, STAT, ERK, JAK-STAT,IRF7-NFkB signaling, and MYD88/CXCR6 immune signaling were particularlyidentified. Based on the identified signaling pathways and GOs, a set ofpotentially effective drugs were repurposed by integrating the drug-target andreverse gene expression data resources. The dexamethasone was top-ranked in theprediction, which was the first reported drug to be able to significantlyreduce the death rate of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support. Theresults can be helpful to understand the associated molecular signalingpathways within host cells, and facilitate the discovery of effective drugs forCOVID-19 treatment.;/abs/2006.01226

Within host dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in humans: Modeling immune responses  and antiviral treatments";(Submitted on 3 Jun 2020 (;Indrajit Ghosh;;;;;In December 2019, a newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus was emerged from Chinaand propagated worldwide as a pandemic. In the absence of preventive medicineor a ready to use vaccine, mathematical models can provide useful scientificinsights about transmission patterns and targets for drug development. In thisstudy, we propose a within-host mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 infectionconsidering innate and adaptive immune responses. We analyze the equilibriumpoints of the proposed model and obtain an expression of the basic reproductionnumber. We then numerically show the existence of a transcritical bifurcation.The proposed model is calibrated to real viral load data of two COVID-19patients. Using the estimated parameters, we perform global sensitivityanalysis with respect to the peak of viral load. Finally, we study the efficacyof antiviral drugs and vaccination on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ourresults suggest that blocking the production of the virus by infected cellsdecreases the viral load more than reducing the infection rate of healthycells. Vaccination is also found useful but during the vaccine developmentphase, blocking virus production from infected cells can be targeted forantiviral drug development.;/abs/2006.02936

Many of these strategies rely on therepositioning of existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the costcompared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we presented a newnetwork-based algorithm for drug repositioning, called SAveRUNNER (Searchingoff-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), which predicts drug-disease associations byquantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specificproteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measurethat prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the samenetwork neighborhoods. Specifically, we applied SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14selected diseases with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causinggenes and that have been found to be related to COVID-19 for geneticsimilarity, comorbidity, or for their association to drugs tentativelyrepurposed to treat COVID-19. Focusing specifically on SARS subnetwork, weidentified 282 repurposable drugs, including some the most rumored off-labeldrugs for COVID-19 treatments, as well as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs,actually used in clinical practice. Furthermore, to maximize the efficiency ofputative downstream validation experiments, we prioritized 24 potentialanti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs based on their network-based similarityvalues. These top-ranked drugs include ACE-inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies,and thrombin inhibitors. Finally, our findings were in-silico validated byperforming a gene set enrichment analysis, which confirmed that most of thenetwork-predicted repurposable drugs may have a potential treatment effectagainst human coronavirus infections.;/abs/2006.03110

Figini;In this work, using a detailed dataset furnished by National HealthAuthorities concerning the Province of Pavia (Lombardy, Italy), we propose todetermine the essential features of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in term ofcontact dynamics. Our contribution is devoted to provide a possible planning ofthe needs of medical infrastructures in the Pavia Province and to suggestdifferent scenarios about the vaccination campaign which possibly help inreducing the fatalities and/or reducing the number of infected in thepopulation. The proposed research combines a new mathematical description ofthe spread of an infectious diseases which takes into account both age andaverage daily social contacts with a detailed analysis of the dataset of alltraced infected individuals in the Province of Pavia. These information areused to develop a data-driven model in which calibration and feeding of themodel are extensively used. The epidemiological evolution is obtained byrelying on an approach based on statical mechanics. This leads to study theevolution over time of a system of probability distributions characterizing theage and social contacts of the population. One of the main outcomes shows that,as expected, the spread of the disease is closely related to the mean number ofcontacts of individuals. The model permits to forecast thanks to an uncertaintyquantification approach and in the short time horizon, the average number andthe confidence bands of expected hospitalized classified by age and to testdifferent options for an effective vaccination campaign with age-decreasingpriority.;/abs/2103.06027

Relaxing restrictions at the pace of vaccination increases freedom and  guards against further COVID-19 waves in Europe";(Submitted on 10 Mar 2021 (;Simon Bauer;Sebastian Contreras;Jonas Dehning;Matthias Linden;Emil Iftekhar;"Mass vaccination offers a promising exit strategy for the COVID-19 pandemic.However, as vaccination progresses, demands to lift restrictions increase,despite most of the population still being susceptible. Using ourage-stratified model and curated epidemiological and vaccination data, wequantified at which pace European countries can lift restrictions withoutoverwhelming their health-care systems. The analysed scenarios range fromimmediately lifting restriction (accepting high mortality and morbidity) toreducing case numbers until test-trace-and-isolate programs facilitate control.In general, the age-dependent vaccination roll-out implies a transient decreasein the average age of ICU patients and deaths by about seven years. The pace ofvaccination determines the speed of lifting restrictions; all scenarios allowto steadily increase contacts starting in May 2021 and relax most restrictionsby autumn 2021. Throughout summer, only moderate contact restrictions remainnecessary. However, with the assumed vaccination protection, further wavesamong the unvaccinated population can only be avoided with high vaccine uptake(>90\%). Strategies that maintain low case numbers instead of high ones reduceinfections and deaths by a factor of eight and four. Policies with low casenumbers significantly benefit from vaccination, as the overall reduction insusceptibility will further diminish viral spread. Keeping case numbers low isthe safest long-term strategy because it i) considerably reduces mortality andmorbidity, ii) offers better preparedness against escape virus variants, andiii) allows higher contact numbers (""freedom"") over the summer.";/abs/2103.06228

How will mass-vaccination change COVID-19 lockdown requirements in  Australia?";(Submitted on 12 Mar 2021 (;Cameron Zachreson;Sheryl L. Chang;Oliver M. Cliff;Mikhail Prokopenko;;To prevent future outbreaks of COVID-19, Australia is pursuing amass-vaccination approach in which a targeted group of the populationcomprising healthcare workers, aged-care residents and other individuals atincreased risk of exposure will receive a highly effective priority vaccine.The rest of the population will instead have access to a less effectivevaccine. We apply a large-scale agent-based model of COVID-19 in Australia toinvestigate the possible implications of this hybrid approach tomass-vaccination. The model is calibrated to recent epidemiological anddemographic data available in Australia, and accounts for several components ofvaccine efficacy. Within a feasible range of vaccine efficacy values, our modelsupports the assertion that complete herd immunity due to vaccination is notlikely in the Australian context. For realistic scenarios in which herdimmunity is not achieved, we simulate the effects of mass-vaccination onepidemic growth rate, and investigate the requirements of lockdown measuresapplied to curb subsequent outbreaks. In our simulations, Australia'svaccination strategy can feasibly reduce required lockdown intensity andinitial epidemic growth rate by 43\% and 52\%, respectively. The severity ofepidemics, as measured by the peak number of daily new cases, decreases by upto two orders of magnitude under plausible mass-vaccination and lockdownstrategies. The study presents a strong argument for a large-scale vaccinationcampaign, which would significantly reduce the intensity of non-pharmaceuticalinterventions in Australia and curb future outbreaks.;/abs/2103.07061

The question remains if there are other more infectiousvariants transmitted around the world. We carry out a large-scale study of252,874 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates from patients to identify many other rapidlygrowing mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RDB). Wereveal that 88 out of 95 significant mutations that were observed more than 10times strengthen the binding between the RBD and the hostangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicating the virus evolves towardmore infectious variants. In particular, we discover new fast-growing RBDmutations N439K, L452R, S477N, S477R, and N501T that also enhance the RBD andACE2 binding. We further unveil that mutation N501Y involved in United Kingdom(UK), South Africa, and Brazil variants may moderately weaken the bindingbetween the RBD and many known antibodies, while mutations E484K and K417Nfound in South Africa and Brazilian variants can potentially disrupt thebinding between the RDB and many known antibodies. Among three newly identifiedfast-growing RBD mutations, L452R, which is now known as part of the Californiavariant B.1.427, and N501T are able to effectively weaken the binding of manyknown antibodies with the RBD. Finally, we hypothesize that RBD mutations thatcan simultaneously make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious and disrupt the existingantibodies, called vaccine escape mutations, will pose an imminent threat tothe current crop of vaccines.

Interplay between COVID-19 vaccines and social measures for ending the  SARS-CoV-2 pandemic";(Submitted on 6 Mar 2021);Glenn Young;Pengcheng Xiao;Kenneth Newcomb;Edwin Michael;;The development and authorization of COVID-19 vaccines has provided theclearest path forward to eliminate community spread hence end the ongoingSARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the limited pace at which the vaccine can beadministered motivates the question, to what extent must we continue to adhereto social intervention measures such as mask wearing and social distancing? Toaddress this question, we develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 spreadincorporating both vaccine dynamics and socio-epidemiological parameters. Weuse this model to study two important measures of disease control anderadication, the effective reproductive number $R_t$ and the peak intensivecare unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence,vaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Our results suggest that, due tothe slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained bya large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of thepopulation becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast,with reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatlyexceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life. These findingshighlight the complex interplays involved between vaccination and socialprotective measures, and indicate the practical importance of continuing withextent social measures while vaccines are scaled up to allow the development ofthe herd immunity needed to end or control SARS-CoV-2 sustainably.;/abs/2103.06120

Prediction of potential commercially inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 by  multi-task deep model";(Submitted on 2 Mar 2020);Fan Hu;Jiaxin Jiang;Peng Yin;;;The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) caused thousands ofdeaths worldwide, and the number of total infections is still rising. However,the development of effective vaccine for this novel virus would take a fewmonths. Thus it is urgent to identify some potentially effective old drugs thatcan be used immediately. Fortunately, some compounds that can inhibitcoronavirus in vitro have been reported. In this study, thecoronavirus-specific dataset was used to fine-tune our pre-trained multi-taskdeep model. Next we used the re-trained model to select available commercialdrugs against targeted proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that abacavir,a powerful nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to treat HIV,is predicted to have high binding affinity with several proteins of SARS-CoV-2.Almitrine mesylate and roflumilast which are used for respiratory diseases suchas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are also predicted to have inhibitoryeffect. Overall, ten drugs are listed as potential inhibitors and the importantsites for these binding by our model are exhibited.

To avoid alarger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government carried out a series ofstrong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantineis the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order toestimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population intoseven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure andofficially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed modelis given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe thetransmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trendof the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important rolein controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. Thecontrol reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed anddiscussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic isin decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-humantransmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 maybecome a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the diseaseis still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of thevirus and the meteorological conditions.

We selected nine drugs from HIV-1protease inhibitors and twenty-one candidates from anti bronchitis drugs basedon their chemical structures and enrolled them in blind and activesite-directed dockings in different modes and in native-like conditions ofinteractions. Our findings suggest the binding capacity and the inhibitorypotency of candidates are as followsTipranavir>Indinavir>Atazanavir>Darunavir>Ritonavir>Amprenavir for HIV-1protease inhibitors and Cefditoren>Cefixime>Erythromycin>Clarithromycin foranti bronchitis medicines. The drugs bioavailability, their hydrophobicity andthe hydrophobic properties of their binding sites and also the rates of theirmetabolisms and deactivations in the human body are the next determinants fortheir overall effects on viral infections, the net results that should surveyby clinical trials to assess their therapeutic usefulness for coronavirusinfections.;/abs/2003.04524

COVID-19 Evolves in Human Hosts";(Submitted on 12 Mar 2020 (;Yanni Li;Bing Liu;Zhi Wang;Jiangtao Cui;Kaicheng Yao;Today, we are all threatened by an unprecedented pandemic: COVID-19. Howdifferent is it from other coronaviruses? Will it be attenuated or become morevirulent? Which animals may be its original host? In this study, we collectedand analyzed nearly thirty thousand publicly available complete genomesequences for COVID-19 virus from 79 different countries, the previously knownflu-causing coronaviruses (HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63 and HCov-HKU1) andthe lethal, pathogenic viruses, SARS, MERS, Victoria, Lassa, Yamagata, Ebola,and Dengue. We found strong similarities between the current circulatingCOVID-19 and SARS and MERS, as well as COVID-19 in rhinolophines and pangolins.On the contrary, COVID-19 shares little similarity with the flu-causingcoronaviruses and the other known viruses. Strikingly, we observed that thedivergence of COVID-19 strains isolated from human hosts has steadily increasedfrom December 2019 to May 2020, suggesting COVID-19 is actively evolving inhuman hosts. In this paper, we first propose a novel MLCS algorithm NP-MLCS1for the big sequence analysis, which can calculate the common model forCOVID-19 complete genome sequences to provide important information for vaccineand antibody development. Geographic and time-course analysis of the evolutiontrees of the human COVID-19 reveals possible evolutional paths among strainsfrom 79 countries.

Spatio-temporal propagation of COVID-19 pandemics";(Submitted on 18 Mar 2020 (;Bnaya Gross;Zhiguo Zheng;Shiyan Liu;Xiaoqi Chen;Alon Sela;The new coronavirus known as COVID-19 is spread world-wide since December2019. Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it arelimited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporalpropagation of the first wave of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it toother global locations. We provide a comprehensive picture of the spatialpropagation from Hubei to other provinces in China in terms of distance,population size, and human mobility and their scaling relations. Since strictquarantine has been usually applied between cities, more insight about thetemporal evolution of the disease can be obtained by analyzing the epidemicwithin cities, especially the time evolution of the infection, death, andrecovery rates which affected by policies. We study and compare the infectionrate in different cities in China and provinces in Italy and find that thedisease spread is characterized by a two-stages process. At early times, atorder of few days, the infection rate is close to a constant probably due tothe lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection symptoms areobserved. Then at later times it decays approximately exponentially due toquarantines. The time evolution of the death and recovery rates alsodistinguish between these two stages and reflect the health system situationwhich could be overloaded.;/abs/2003.08382

Post-Lockdown Abatement of COVID-19 by Fast Periodic Switching";(Submitted on 22 Mar 2020 (;M. Bin;P. Cheung;E. Crisostomi;P. Ferraro;H.

We show -- as proof of concept grounded onrigorous mathematical evidence -- that periodic, high-frequency alternation ofinto, and out-of, lockdown effectively mitigates second-wave effects, whileallowing continued, albeit reduced, economic activity. Periodicity confers (i)predictability, which is essential for economic sustainability, and (ii)robustness, since lockdown periods are not activated by uncertain measurementsover short time scales. In turn -- while not eliminating the virus -- this fastswitching policy is sustainable over time, and it mitigates the infection untila vaccine or treatment becomes available, while alleviating the social costsassociated with long lockdowns. Typically, the policy might be in the form of1-day of work followed by 6-days of lockdown every week (or perhaps 2 daysworking, 5 days off) and it can be modified at a slow-rate based onmeasurements filtered over longer time scales. Our results highlight thepotential efficacy of high frequency switching interventions in post lockdownmitigation. All code is available on Github(;/abs/2003.09930

More than 125000 confirmed cases and 4,607 death caseshave been recorded around more than 118 countries. Unfortunately, a coronavirusvaccine is expected to take at least 18 months if it works at all. Moreover,COVID -19 epidemics can mutate into a more aggressive form. Day levelinformation about the COVID -19 spread is crucial to measure the behavior ofthis new virus globally. Therefore, this study presents a comparison of daylevel forecasting models on COVID-19 affected cases using time series modelsand mathematical formulation. The forecasting models and data strongly suggestthat the number of coronavirus cases grows exponentially in countries that donot mandate quarantines, restrictions on travel and public gatherings, andclosing of schools, universities, and workplaces (Social Distancing).;/abs/2003.07778

Genotyping coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: methods and implications";(Submitted on 24 Mar 2020);Changchuan Yin;;;;;The emerging global infectious COVID-19 coronavirus disease by novel SevereAcute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents critical threatsto global public health and the economy since it was identified in lateDecember 2019 in China. The virus has gone through various pathways ofevolution. For understanding the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2,genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. We present an accuratemethod for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes.The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates withthe SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The SNP genotypes are then measured by Jaccarddistances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysisof SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutationsare the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. Our methodserves a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenicviruses in their gradual and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysisshows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase,and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical forvaccine development in disease control.;/abs/2003.10965

Personalized workflow to identify optimal T-cell epitopes for  peptide-based vaccines against COVID-19";(Submitted on 24 Mar 2020);Rui Qiao;Ngoc Hieu Tran;Baozhen Shan;Ali Ghodsi;Ming Li;Traditional vaccines against viruses are designed to target their surfaceproteins, i.e., antigens, which can trigger the immune system to producespecific antibodies to capture and neutralize the viruses. However, virusesoften evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoidrecognition by the antibodies (antigenic drift). This limitation of theantibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity,which is able to recognize conserved viral HLA peptides presented onvirus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting conserved regions on the genome of avirus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and maywork effectively on different strains of the virus. Here we propose apersonalized workflow to identify an optimal set of T-cell epitopes based onthe HLA alleles and the immunopeptidome of an individual person. Specifically,our workflow trains a machine learning model on the immunopeptidome and thenpredicts HLA peptides from conserved regions of a virus that are most likely totrigger responses from the person T cells. We applied the workflow to identifyT-cell epitopes for the SARS-COV-2 virus, which has caused the recent COVID-19pandemic in more than 100 countries across the globe.;/abs/2003.10650

Distant sequence similarity between hepcidin and the novel coronavirus  spike glycoprotein: a potential hint at the possibility of local iron  dysregulation in COVID-19";(Submitted on 27 Mar 2020 (;Sepehr Ehsani;;;;;The spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, hasattracted attention for its vaccine potential and binding capacity to host cellsurface receptors. Much of this research focus has centered on the ectodomainof the spike protein. The ectodomain is anchored to a transmembrane region,followed by a cytoplasmic tail. Here we report a distant sequence similaritybetween the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail of the coronavirus spike protein andthe hepcidin protein that is found in humans and other vertebrates. Hepcidin isthought to be the key regulator of iron metabolism in humans. An implication ofthis preliminary observation is to suggest a potential route of investigationin the coronavirus research field making use of an already-establishedliterature on the interplay of local and systemic iron regulation,cytokine-mediated inflammatory processes, respiratory infections and thehepcidin protein.

The structures of social contact critically determine the spread ofthe infection and, in the absence of vaccines, the control of these structuresthrough large-scale social distancing measures appears to be the most effectivemeans of mitigation. Here we use an age-structured SIR model with socialcontact matrices obtained from surveys and Bayesian imputation to study theprogress of the COVID-19 epidemic in India. The basic reproductive ratio R0 andits time-dependent generalization are computed based on case data, agedistribution and social contact structure. The impact of social distancingmeasures - workplace non-attendance, school closure, lockdown - and theirefficacy with durations are then investigated. A three-week lockdown is foundinsufficient to prevent a resurgence and, instead, protocols of sustainedlockdown with periodic relaxation are suggested. Forecasts are provided for thereduction in age-structured morbidity and mortality as a result of thesemeasures. Our study underlines the importance of age and social contactstructures in assessing the country-specific impact of mitigatory socialdistancing.;/abs/2003.12055

Alternating quarantine for sustainable epidemic mitigation";(Submitted on 3 Apr 2020 (;Dror Meidan;Nava Schulmann;Reuven Cohen;Simcha Haber;Eyal Yaniv;Absent a drug or vaccine, containing epidemic outbreaks is achieved by meansof social distancing, specifically mobility restrictions and lock-downs. Suchmeasures impose a hurtful toll on the economy, and are difficult to sustain forextended periods. As an alternative, we propose here an alternating quarantinestrategy, in which at every instance, half of the population remains underlock-down while the other half continues to be active, maintaining a routine ofweekly succession between activity and quarantine. This regime affords a dualpartition:\ half of the population interacts for only half of the time,resulting in a dramatic reduction in transmission, comparable to that achievedby a population-wide lock-down. All the while, it enables socioeconomiccontinuity at $50\%$ capacity. The proposed weekly alternations also address anadditional challenge, with specific relevance to COVID-19. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2exhibits a relatively long incubation period, in which individuals experienceno symptoms, but may already contribute to the spread. Unable to selectivelyisolate these invisible spreaders, we resort to population-wide restrictions.However, under the alternating quarantine routine, if an individual was exposedduring their active week, by the time they complete their quarantine they will,in most cases, begin to exhibit symptoms. Hence this strategy isolates themajority of pre-symptomatic individuals during their infectious phase, leadingto a rapid decline in the viral spread, thus addressing one of the mainchallenges in COVID-19 mitigation.;/abs/2004.01453

In Silico Screening of Some Naturally Occurring Bioactive Compounds  Predicts Potential Inhibitors against SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) Protease";(Submitted on 3 Apr 2020);Ashok Kumar Mishra;Satya Prakash Tewari;;;;"SARS-COV-2 identified as COVID-19 in Wuhan city of China in the month ofDecember, 2019 has now been declared as pandemic by World Health Organizationwhose transmission chain and cure both have emerged as a tough problem for themedical fraternity. The reports pertaining to the treatment of this pandemicare still lacking. We firmly believe that Nature itself provides a simplesolution for any complicated problem created in it which motivated us to carryout In Silico investigations on some bioactive natural compounds reportedlyfound in the fruits and leaves of Anthocephalus Cadamba which is a miraculousplant found on the earth aiming to predict the potential inhibitors againstaforesaid virus. Having modeled the ground state ligand structure of the suchnine natural compounds applying density functional theory at B3LYP/631+G (d, p)level we have performed their molecular docking with SARS-COV-2 protease tocalculate the binding affinity as well as to screen the binding at S-proteinsite during ligand-protein interactions. Out of these nine studied naturallyoccurring compounds; Oleanic Acid has been appeared to be potential inhibitorfor COVID-19 followed by Ursolic Acid,IsoVallesiachotamine,Vallesiachotamine,Cadambine,Vincosamide-N-Oxide,Isodihydroamino-cadambine, Pentyle Ester of Chlorogenic Acid andD-Myo-Inositol. Hence these bioactive natural compounds or their structuralanalogs may be explored as anti-COVID19 drug agent which will be possessing thepeculiar feature of cost-less synthesis and less or no side effect due to theirnatural occurrence.

The nodes of the network represent differenttypes of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships.An epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered onday $0$ by a seed infection introduced into the population. Individuals' socialbehaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probabilitydistributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis isgiven for the basic SI (""susceptible-infective"") network contagion model, whichfocusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The mainresult is an analytical formula valid in the large $N$ limit for the state ofthe system on day $t$ in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involvesonly one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR networkmodels, including ""removed"" (R) and ""exposed"" (E) classes, are formulated.These models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results forthe SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis ofdifferent kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, socialdistancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by analgorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally anumber of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such asthe framework's relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agentbased contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemicmodelling.";/abs/2004.02779

Reaction Cycles of Halogen Species in the Immune Defense: Implications  for Human Health and Diseases and the Pathology and Treatment of COVID-19";(Submitted on 6 Apr 2020 (;Qing-Bin Lu;;;;;There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. One currentfocus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeuticefficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID-19 is essentiallyunknown. It is therefore challenging to discover a successful treatment to beapproved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biologicalprocesses of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS)that play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to humans. Theseinclude why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation ofH2O2, are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, whythe amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevantdoses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely producedin the cell and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role inphagocytosis for immune defense. Herein we propose a plausible amplificationmechanism in immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactionsenhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiologicalfunctions, which are activated by H2O2 and deactivated by NO signalingmolecule. Our results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousandsof times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 100,000 foldin phagocytosis, resembling the cyclic ozone-depleting reactions in thestratosphere. It is unraveled that H2O2 is a required protective signalingmolecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction cancause many diseases or conditions such as autoimmune disorders, aging andcancer.

By validating our model to the dataon notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimatedseveral epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basicreproduction number ($R_{0}$). Combining the mechanistic mathematical modelwith different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in thesix locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020.

Weconsider the initial phase of the outbreak situation in India and our proposedmodel is fitted to the daily cumulative new reported cases during the period$2^{nd}$ March, 2020 to $24^{th}$ March, 2020. We estimate the basicreproduction number $(R_0)$, effective reproduction number (R(t)) and epidemicdoubling time from the incidence data for the above-mentioned period. Wefurther assess the effect of preventive measures such as spread of awareness,lock-down, proper hand sanitization, etc. in reducing the new cases. Twointervention scenarios are considered depending on the variability of theintervention strength over the period of implementation. Our study suggeststhat higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreakwithin a shorter period of time in India. Moreover, our analysis reveals thatthe strength of the intervention should be strengthened over the time toeradicate the disease effectively.;/abs/2004.04950

A kinetic model for qualitative understanding and analysis of the effect  of complete lockdown imposed by India for controlling the COVID-19 disease  spread by the SARS-CoV-2 virus";(Submitted on 12 Apr 2020);Raj Kishore;Prashant Kumar Jha;Shreeja Das;Dheeresh Agarwal;Tanmay Maloo;"The present ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is creatinghavoc across the world. The absence of any vaccine as well as any definitivedrug to cure, has made the situation very grave. Therefore only few effectivetools are available to contain the rapid pace of spread of this disease, namedas COVID-19. On 24th March, 2020, the the Union Government of India made anannouncement of unprecedented complete lockdown of the entire country effectivefrom the next day. No exercise of similar scale and magnitude has been everundertaken anywhere on the globe in the history of entire mankind. This studyaims to scientifically analyze the implications of this decision using akinetic model covering more than 96% of Indian territory. This model wasfurther constrained by large sets of realistic parameters pertinent to India inorder to capture the ground realities prevailing in India, such as: (i) truestate wise population density distribution, (ii) accurate state wise infectiondistribution for the zeroth day of simulation (20th March, 2020), (iii)realistic movements of average clusters, (iv) rich diversity in movementspatterns across different states, (v) migration patterns across differentgeographies, (vi) different migration patterns for pre- and post-COVID-19outbreak, (vii) Indian demographic data based on the 2011 census, (viii) WorldHealth Organization (WHO) report on demography wise infection rate and (ix)incubation period as per WHO report. This model does not attempt to make along-term prediction about the disease spread on a standalone basis; but tocompare between two different scenarios (complete lockdown vs. no lockdown). Inthe framework of model assumptions, our model conclusively shows significantsuccess of the lockdown in containing the disease within a tiny fraction of thepopulation and in the absence of it, it would have led to a very gravesituation.";/abs/2004.05684

Deciphering the Protein Motion of S1 Subunit in SARS-CoV-2 Spike  Glycoprotein Through Integrated Computational Methods";(Submitted on 10 Apr 2020);Hao Tian;Peng Tao;;;;The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is amajor worldwide public health emergency that has infected over $1.5$ millionpeople. The partially open state of S1 subunit in spike glycoprotein isconsidered vital for its infection with host cell and is represented as a keytarget for neutralizing antibodies. However, the mechanism elucidating thetransition from the closed state to the partially open state still remainsunclear. Here, we applied a combination of Markov state model, transition paththeory and random forest to analyze the S1 motion. Our results explored apromising complete conformational movement of receptor-binding domain, fromburied, partially open, to detached states. We also numerically confirmed thetransition probability between those states. Based on the asymmetry in both thedynamics behavior and backbone C$\alpha$ importance, we further suggested arelation between chains in the trimer spike protein, which may help in thevaccine design and antibody neutralization.;/abs/2004.05256

While vaccines are still under development, social distancing,extensive testing, and quarantining of confirmed infected subjects remain themost effective measures to contain the pandemic. These measures carry asignificant socioeconomic cost. In this work, we introduce a noveloptimization-based decision-making framework for managing the COVID-19 outbreakin the US. This includes modeling the dynamics of affected populations,estimating the model parameters and hidden states from data, and an optimalcontrol strategy for sequencing social distancing and testing events such thatthe number of infections is minimized. The analysis of our extensivecomputational efforts reveals that social distancing and quarantining are mosteffective when implemented early, with quarantining of confirmed infectedsubjects having a much higher impact. Further, we find that ""on-off"" policiesalternating between strict social distancing and relaxing such restrictions canbe effective at ""flattening"" the curve while likely minimizing social andeconomic cost.";/abs/2004.06291

COVID-19 Antibody Test / Vaccination Certification: There's an app for  that";(Submitted on 15 Apr 2020 (;Marc Eisenstadt;Manoharan Ramachandran;Niaz Chowdhury;Allan Third;John Domingue;Goal: As the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2019/2020 unfolds, a COVID-19 'ImmunityPassport' has been mooted as a way to enable individuals to return back towork. While the quality of antibody testing, the availability of vaccines, andthe likelihood of even attaining COVID-19 immunity continue to be researched,we address the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and privacy-preservingcertification for test results and vaccinations. Methods: We developed aprototype mobile phone app and requisite decentralized server architecture thatfacilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personallyidentifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the appallows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result withno other personal information revealed. The architecture, designed forscalability, relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called'Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal dataplatform 'Solid', and (c) a Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Ourmobile phone app and decentralized server architecture enable the mixture ofverifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs anddigital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitivedigital keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it to scale linearlyin the worst case, as significant processing is done locally on each app. Forthe test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. healthcare staff, pharmacy) andVerifier (e.g. employer), it is 'just another app' which takes only minutes touse. Conclusions: The app and decentralized server architecture offer aprototype proof of concept that is readily scalable, applicable generically,and in effect 'waiting in the wings' for the biological issues, plus keyethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be resolved.;/abs/2004.07376

Mathematical assessment of the impact of non-pharmaceutical  interventions on curtailing the 2019 novel Coronavirus";(Submitted on 15 Apr 2020 (;Calistus N. Ngonghala;Enahoro Iboi;Steffen Eikenberry;Matthew Scotch;Chandini Raina MacIntyre;A novel Coronavirus pandemic emerged in December of 2019, causing devastatingpublic health impact across the world. In the absence of a safe and effectivevaccine or antiviral, strategies for mitigating the burden of the pandemic arefocused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing,contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation and the use of face-masks in public. Wedevelop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact ofthese mitigation strategies. Simulations of the model, using data relevant toCOVID-19 transmission in New York state and the entire US, show that thepandemic will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenarioprojections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels ofanti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) in NewYork State and the entire US decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%,respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented aremaintained until the end of May or June, 2020. This study shows that earlytermination of strict social-distancing could trigger a devastating second wavewith burden similar to that projected before the onset of strictsocial-distance. The use of efficacious face-masks (efficacy greater than 70%)could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residentsof New York state use such masks consistently (nationwide, a compliance of atleast 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks,such as cloth masks (of efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significantreduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead toelimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of otheranti-COVID-19 intervention measures can lead to elimination of the pandemic.The mask coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if mask-use iscombined with strict social-distancing.;/abs/2004.07391

Determination of an Optimal Control Strategy for Vaccine Administration  in COVID-19 Pandemic Treatment";(Submitted on 15 Apr 2020 (;Gustavo Barbosa Libotte;Fran Sérgio Lobato;Gustavo Mendes Platt;Antônio José da Silva Neto;;During decades, mathematical models have been used to predict the behavior ofphysical and biologic systems, and to define strategies aiming the minimizationof the effects regarding different types of diseases. In the present days, thedevelopment of mathematical models to simulate the dynamic behavior of novelcoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is considered an important theme due to thequantity of infected people worldwide. In this work, the aim is to determine anoptimal control strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemictreatment considering real data from China. For this purpose, an inverseproblem is formulated and solved in order to determine the parameters of thecompartmental SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model. To solve suchinverse problem, the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is employed. Afterthis step, two optimal control problems (mono- and multi-objective) todetermine the optimal strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemictreatment are proposed. The first consists of minimizing the quantity ofinfected individuals during the treatment. The second considers minimizingtogether the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccineconcentration during the treatment, i.e., a multi-objective optimal controlproblem. The solution of each optimal control problems is obtained using DE andMulti-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithms, respectively. Theresults regarding the proposed multi-objective optimal control problem providesa set of evidences from which an optimal strategy for vaccine administrationcan be chosen, according to a given criterion.;/abs/2004.07397

Beyond just ""flattening the curve"": Optimal control of epidemics with  purely non-pharmaceutical interventions";(Submitted on 20 Apr 2020 (;Markus Kantner;Thomas Koprucki;;;;"When effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available,non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, home quarantine andfar-reaching shutdown of public life are the only available strategies toprevent the spread of epidemics. Based on an extended SEIR(susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model and continuous-time optimalcontrol theory, we compute the optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention strategyfor the case that a vaccine is never found and complete containment(eradication of the epidemic) is impossible. In this case, the optimal controlmust meet competing requirements: First, the minimization of disease-relateddeaths, and, second, the establishment of a sufficient degree of naturalimmunity at the end of the measures, in order to exclude a second wave.Moreover, the socio-economic costs of the intervention shall be kept at aminimum. The numerically computed optimal control strategy is asingle-intervention scenario that goes beyond heuristically motivatedinterventions and simple ""flattening of the curve."" Careful analysis of thecomputed control strategy reveals, however, that the obtained solution is infact a tightrope walk close to the stability boundary of the system, wheresocio-economic costs and the risk of a new outbreak must be constantly balancedagainst one another. The model system is calibrated to reproduce the initialexponential growth phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.";/abs/2004.09471

Individuals may modify their behavior and takepreventative steps to reduce infection risk in the bid to adhere to the call bygovernment officials and experts. As a result, the existence of relationshipbetween the preliminary and the final transmission rates become feeble. Thisstudy evaluates the behavioral changes (mitigation and suppression measures)proposed by public health experts for COVID-19 which had altered human behaviorand their day to day lives. The dynamics underlying the mitigation andsuppression measures reduces the contacts among citizens and significantlyinterfere with their physical and social behavior. The results show all themeasures have a significant impact on the decline of transmission rate.However, the mitigation measures might prolong the elimination of thetransmission which might lead to a severe economic meltdown, yet, a combinationof the measures show a possibility of rooting out transmission within 30 daysif adhered to in an extreme manner.

LinearDesign: Efficient Algorithms for Optimized mRNA Sequence Design";(Submitted on 21 Apr 2020 (;He Zhang;Liang Zhang;Ziyu Li;Kaibo Liu;Boxiang Liu;A messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine has emerged as a promising direction to combatthe current COVID-19 pandemic. This requires an mRNA sequence that is stableand highly productive in protein expression, features which have been shown tobenefit from greater mRNA secondary structure folding stability and optimalcodon usage. However, sequence design remains a hard problem due to theexponentially many synonymous mRNA sequences that encode the same protein. Weshow that this design problem can be reduced to a classical problem in formallanguage theory and computational linguistics that can be solved in O(n^3)time, where n is the mRNA sequence length. This algorithm could still be tooslow for large n (e.g., n = 3, 822 nucleotides for the spike protein ofSARS-CoV-2), so we further developed a linear-time approximate version,LinearDesign, inspired by our recent work, LinearFold. This algorithm,LinearDesign, can compute the approximate minimum free energy mRNA sequence forthis spike protein in just 11 minutes using beam size b = 1, 000, with only0.6% loss in free energy change compared to exact search (i.e., b = +infinity,which costs 1 hour). We also develop two algorithms for incorporating the codonoptimality into the design, one based on k-best parsing to find alternativesequences and one directly incorporating codon optimality into the dynamicprogramming.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 aredry cough, sore throat, and fever. Symptoms can progress to a severe form ofpneumonia with critical complications, including septic shock, pulmonary edema,acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. While medicalimaging is not currently recommended in Canada for primary diagnosis ofCOVID-19, computer-aided diagnosis systems could assist in the early detectionof COVID-19 abnormalities and help to monitor the progression of the disease,potentially reduce mortality rates.

Mobility Based SIR Model For Pandemics -- With Case Study Of COVID-19";(Submitted on 26 Apr 2020);Rahul Goel;Rajesh Sharma;;;;In the last decade, humanity has faced many different pandemics such as SARS,H1N1, and presently novel coronavirus (COVID-19). On one side, scientists arefocusing on vaccinations, and on the other side, there is a need to proposemodels that can help us in understanding the spread of these pandemics as itcan help governmental and other concerned agencies to be well prepared,especially from pandemics, which spreads faster like COVID-19. The main reasonfor some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among differentregions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographicalarea, often worldwide. In addition, the population distribution and socialcoherence in the different regions of the world is non-uniform. Thus, once theepidemic enters a region, then the local population distribution plays animportant role. Inspired by these ideas, we proposed a mobility-based SIR modelfor epidemics, which especially takes into account pandemic situations. To thebest of our knowledge, this model is first of its kind, which takes intoaccount the population distribution and connectivity of different geographiclocations across the globe. In addition to presenting the mathematical proof ofour model, we have performed extensive simulations using synthetic data todemonstrate our model's generalizability. To demonstrate the wider scope of ourmodel, we used our model to forecast the COVID-19 cases for Estonia.;/abs/2004.13015

As a consequence of its highly infectious nature,countries all over the world have imposed extremely strict measures to controlits spread. Since the earliest stages of this major pandemic, academics havedone a huge amount of research in order to understand the disease, developmedication, vaccines and tests, and model its spread. Among these studies, agreat deal of effort has been invested in the estimation of epidemic parametersin the early stage, for the countries affected by Covid-19, hence to predictthe course of the epidemic but the variability of the controls over the courseof the epidemic complicated the modeling processes. In this article, thedetermination of the basic reproduction number, the mean duration of theinfectious period, the estimation of the timing of the peak of the epidemicwave is discussed using early phase data. Daily case reports and dailyfatalities for ten countries over the period January 22, 2020 - April 18, 2020are evaluated using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. For eachcountry, the SIR models fitting cumulative infective case data within 5% errorare analysed. It is observed that the basic reproduction number and the meanduration of the infectious period can be estimated only in cases where thespread of the epidemic is over (for China and South Korea in the present case).Nevertheless, it is shown that the timing of the maximum and timings of theinflection points of the proportion of infected individuals can be robustlyestimated from the normalized data. The validation of the estimates bycomparing the predictions with actual data has shown that the predictions wererealised for all countries except USA, as long as lock-down measures wereretained.;/abs/2004.13178

Antimalarial Artefenomel Inhibits Human SARS-CoV-2 Replication in Cells  while Suppressing the Receptor ACE2";(Submitted on 28 Apr 2020 (;Tania Massignan;Alberto Boldrini;Luca Terruzzi;Giovanni Spagnolli;Andrea Astolfi;The steep climbing of victims caused by the new coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) throughout the planet is sparking an unprecedented effort toidentify effective therapeutic regimens to tackle the pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2virus is known to gain entry into various cell types through the binding of oneof its surface proteins (spike) to the host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2(ACE2). Thus, spike-ACE2 interaction represents a major target for vaccines andantiviral drugs. A novel method has been recently described by some of theauthors to pharmacologically downregulate the expression of target proteins atthe post-translational level. This technology builds on computationaladvancements in the simulation of folding mechanisms to rationally blockprotein expression by targeting folding intermediates, hence hampering thefolding process. Here, we report the all-atom simulations of the entiresequence of events underlying the folding pathway of ACE2. Our data revealedthe existence of a folding intermediate showing two druggable pockets hidden inthe native conformation. Both pockets were targeted by a virtual screeningrepurposing campaign aimed at quickly identifying drugs capable to decrease theexpression of ACE2. We identified four compounds capable of lowering ACE2expression in Vero cells in a dose-dependent fashion. All these molecules werefound to inhibit the entry into cells of a pseudotyped retrovirus exposing theSARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Importantly, the antiviral activity has been testedagainst live SARS-CoV-2 (MEX-BC2/2020 strain). One of the selected drugs(Artefenomel) could completely prevent cytopathic effects induced by thepresence of the virus, thus showing antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.Ongoing studies are further evaluating the possibility of repurposing thesedrugs for the treatment of COVID-19.;/abs/2004.13493

Monitoring COVID-19 social distancing with person detection and tracking  via fine-tuned YOLO v3 and Deepsort techniques";(Submitted on 4 May 2020 (;Narinder Singh Punn;Sanjay Kumar Sonbhadra;Sonali Agarwal;;;The rampant coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought global crisiswith its deadly spread to more than 180 countries, and about 3,519,901confirmed cases along with 247,630 deaths globally as on May 4, 2020. Theabsence of any active therapeutic agents and the lack of immunity againstCOVID-19 increases the vulnerability of the population. Since there are novaccines available, social distancing is the only feasible approach to fightagainst this pandemic. Motivated by this notion, this article proposes a deeplearning based framework for automating the task of monitoring socialdistancing using surveillance video. The proposed framework utilizes the YOLOv3 object detection model to segregate humans from the background and Deepsortapproach to track the identified people with the help of bounding boxes andassigned IDs. The results of the YOLO v3 model are further compared with otherpopular state-of-the-art models, e.g. faster region-based CNN (convolutionneural network) and single shot detector (SSD) in terms of mean averageprecision (mAP), frames per second (FPS) and loss values defined by objectclassification and localization. Later, the pairwise vectorized L2 norm iscomputed based on the three-dimensional feature space obtained by using thecentroid coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. The violation indexterm is proposed to quantize the non adoption of social distancing protocol.From the experimental analysis, it is observed that the YOLO v3 with Deepsorttracking scheme displayed best results with balanced mAP and FPS score tomonitor the social distancing in real-time.;/abs/2005.01385

In particular, this paper looks at the deepconvolutional neural networks VGG16 and VGG19, InceptionResNetV2 andInceptionV3, as well as Xception, all followed by a flat multi-layer perceptronand a final 30% drop-out. The paper has found that the best performing networkis VGG16 with a final $30$% drop-out trained over 3 classes (COVID-19, NoFinding, Other Pneumonia). It has an internal cross-validated accuracy of$93.9(\pm3.4)$%, a COVID-19 sensitivity of $87.7(-1.9,+2)$%, and a No Findingsensitivity of $96.8(\pm0.8)$%. The respective external cross-validated valuesare $84.1(\pm13.5)$%, $87.7(-1.9,2)$%, and $96.8(\pm0.8)$%. The model optimizerwas Adam with a 1e-4 learning rate, and categorical cross-entropy loss. It ishoped that, once this research will be put to practice in hospitals, healthcareprofessionals will be able in the medium to long-term to diagnosing throughmachine learning tools possible pneumonia, and if detected, whether it islinked to a COVID-19 infection, allowing the detection of new possible COVID-19foyers after the end of possible ""stop-and-go"" lockdowns as expected by until avaccine is found and widespread. Furthermore, in the short-term, it is hopedpractitioners can compare the diagnosis from the deep convolutional neuralnetworks with possible RT-PCR testing results, and if clashing, a ComputedTomography could be performed as they are more accurate in showing COVID-19pneumonia.";/abs/2005.00845

It would bean absolute tragedy if currently used diagnostic reagents are undermined in anymanner. Based on the genotyping of 7818 SARS-CoV-2 genome samples collected upto May 1, 2020, we reveal that essentially all of the current COVID-19diagnostic targets have had mutations. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 has themost devastating mutations on the targets of various nucleocapsid (N) geneprimers and probes, which have been unfortunately used by countries around theworld to diagnose COVID-19. Our findings explain what has seriously gone wrongwith a specific diagnostic reagent made in China. To understand whetherSARS-CoV-2 genes have mutated unevenly, we have computed the mutation ratio andmutation $h$-index of all SARS-CoV genes, indicating that the N gene is themost non-conservative gene in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our findings enableresearchers to target the most conservative SARS-CoV-2 genes and proteins forthe design and development of COVID-19 diagnostic reagents, preventivevaccines, and therapeutic medicines.;/abs/2005.02188

The WorldHealth Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergencyof International Concern. In Pakistan, the spread of the virus is on the risewith the number of infected people and causalities rapidly increasing. In theabsence of proper vaccination and treatment, to reduce the number of infectionsand casualties, the only option so far is to educate people regardingpreventive measures and to enforce countrywide lock-down. Any strategy aboutthe preventive measures needs to be based upon detailed analysis of theCOVID-19 outbreak and accurate scientific predictions. In this paper, weconduct mathematical and numerical analysis to come up with reliable andaccurate predictions of the outbreak in Pakistan. The time-dependentSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is used to fit the data and providefuture predictions. The turning point of the peak of the pandemic is defined asthe day when the transmission rate becomes less than the recovering rate. Wehave predicted that the outbreak will reach its maximum peak occurring fromlate May to 9 June with unrecovered number of Infectives in the range20000-47000 and the cumulative number of infected cases in the range of57500-153100. The number of Infectives will remain at the lower end in thelock-down scenario but can rapidly double or triple if the spread of theepidemic is not curtailed and localized.

Strategic Spatiotemporal Vaccine Distribution Increases the Survival  Rate in an Infectious Disease like Covid-19";(Submitted on 8 May 2020 (;Jens Grauer;Hartmut Löwen;Benno Liebchen;;;Covid-19 has caused hundred of thousands of deaths and an economic damageamounting to trillions of dollars, creating a desire for the rapid developmentof vaccine. Once available, vaccine is gradually produced, evoking the questionon how to distribute it best. While official vaccination guidelines largelyfocus on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first (e.g. to riskgroups), here we propose a strategy for their distribution in time and space,which sequentially prioritizes regions with a high local infection growth rate.To demonstrate this strategy, we develop a simple statistical model describingthe time-evolution of infection patterns and their response to vaccination, forinfectious diseases like Covid-19. For inhomogeneous infection patterns,locally well-mixed populations and basic reproduction numbers $R_0\sim 1.5-4$the proposed strategy at least halves the number of deaths in our simulationscompared to the standard practice of distributing vaccines proportionally tothe population density. For $R_0\sim 1$ we still find a significant increase ofthe survival rate. The proposed vaccine distribution strategy can be furthertested in detailed modelling works and could excite discussions on theimportance of the spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines for officialguidelines.;/abs/2005.04056

Monte Carlo simulation of SARS-CoV-2 radiation-induced inactivation for  vaccine development";(Submitted on 13 May 2020 (;Ziad Francis;Sebastien Incerti;Sara A. Zein;Nathanael Lampe;Carlos A. Guzman;Immunization with an inactivated virus is one of the strategies currentlybeing tested towards developing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. One of the methods usedto inactivate viruses is exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation to damagetheir nucleic acids. Although gamma-rays effectively induce lesions in the RNA,envelope proteins are also highly damaged in the process. This in turn mayalter their antigenic properties, affecting their capacity to induce anadaptive immune response able to confer effective protection. Here, we modelledthe impact of sparsely and densely ionizing radiation on SARS-CoV-2 using theMonte Carlo toolkit Geant4-DNA. With a realistic 3D target virus model, wecalculated the expected number of lesions in the spike and membrane proteins,as well as in the viral RNA. We show that gamma-rays produce significant spikeprotein damage, but densely ionizing charged particles induce less membranedamage for the same level of RNA lesions, because a single ion traversalthrough the nuclear envelope is sufficient to inactivate the virus. We proposethat accelerated charged particles produce inactivated viruses with littlestructural damage to envelope proteins, thereby representing a new andeffective tool for developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other envelopedviruses.;/abs/2005.06201

The only way to control the COVID-19outbreak is sustained physical distancing. In this work, a simple control lawwas proposed to keep the infected individuals during the COVID-19 outbreakbelow the desired number. The proposed control law keeps the value of infectedindividuals controlled only adjusting the social distancing level. Thestability analysis of the proposed control law is done and the uncertainties inthe parameters were considered. A version of the proposed controller to dailyupdate was developed. This is a very simple approach to the developed controllaw and can be calculated in a spreadsheet. In the end, numerical simulationswere done to show the behavior of the number of infected individuals during anepidemic disease when the proposed control law is used to adjust the socialdistancing level.;/abs/2005.08052

A systems biology approach to COVID-19 progression in a population";(Submitted on 19 May 2020 (;Magdalena Djordjevic;Andjela Rodic;Igor Salom;Dusan Zigic;Ognjen Milicevic;A number of models in mathematical epidemiology have been developed toaccount for control measures such as vaccination or quarantine. However,COVID-19 has brought unprecedented social distancing measures, with a challengeon how to include these in a manner that can explain the data but avoidoverfitting in parameter inference. We here develop a simple time-dependentmodel, where social distancing effects are introduced analogous tocoarse-grained models of gene expression control in systems biology. We applyour approach to understand drastic differences in COVID-19 infection andfatality counts, observed between Hubei (Wuhan) and other Mainland Chinaprovinces. We find that these unintuitive data may be explained through aninterplay of differences in transmissibility, effective protection, anddetection efficiencies between Hubei and other provinces. More generally, ourresults demonstrate that regional differences may drastically shape infectionoutbursts. The obtained results demonstrate the applicability of our developedmethod to extract key infection parameters directly from publically availabledata so that it can be globally applied to outbreaks of COVID-19 in a number ofcountries. Overall, we show that applications of uncommon strategies, such asmethods and approaches from molecular systems biology research to mathematicalepidemiology, may significantly advance our understanding of COVID-19 and otherinfectious diseases.;/abs/2005.09630

An Optimal Predictive Control Strategy for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Social  Distancing Policies in Brazil";(Submitted on 21 May 2020);Marcelo Menezes Morato;Saulo Benchimol Bastos;Daniel Oliveira Cajueiro;Julio Elias Normey-Rico;;The global COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2 virus) is the defining health crisisof our century. Due to the absence of vaccines and drugs that can help to fightit, the world solution to control the spread has been to consider public socialdistance measures that avoids the saturation of the health system. In thiscontext, we investigate a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to determinethe time and duration of social distancing policies. We use Brazilian data inthe period from March to May of 2020. The available data regarding the numberof infected individuals and deaths suffers from sub-notification due to theabsence of mass tests and the relevant presence of the asymptomaticindividuals. We estimate variations of the SIR model using anuncertainty-weighted Least-Squares criterion that considers both nominal andinconsistent-data conditions. Moreover, we add to our versions of the SIR modelan additional dynamic state variable to mimic the response of the population tothe social distancing policies determined by the government that affects thespeed of COVID-19 transmission. Our control framework is within a mixed-logicalformalism, since the decision variable is forcefully binary (the existence orthe absence of social distance policy). A dwell-time constraint is included toavoid harsh shifting between these two states. Finally, we present simulationresults to illustrate how such optimal control policy would operate. Theseresults point out that no social distancing should be relaxed before mid August2020. If relaxations are necessary, they should not be performed before thebeginning this date and should be in small periods, no longer than 25 days.This paradigm would proceed roughly until January/2021. The second peak ofinfections, which has a forecast to the beginning of October, can be reduced ifthe periods of no-isolation days are shortened.;/abs/2005.10797

In this work, we analyze the sources of error intypically reported epidemiological variables and usual tests used fordiagnosis, and their impact on our understanding of COVID-19 spreadingdynamics.

Due to its high conservativeness and low similarity with humangenes, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M$^{\text{pro}}$) is one of the most favorabledrug targets. However, the current understanding of the molecular mechanism ofM$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibition is limited by the lack of reliable binding affinityranking and prediction of existing structures of M$^{\text{pro}}$-inhibitorcomplexes. This work integrates mathematics and deep learning (MathDL) toprovide a reliable ranking of the binding affinities of 92 SARS-CoV-2M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibitor structures. We reveal that Gly143 residue inM$^{\text{pro}}$ is the most attractive site to form hydrogen bonds, followedby Cys145, Glu166, and His163. We also identify 45 targeted covalent bondinginhibitors. Validation on the PDBbind v2016 core set benchmark shows the MathDLhas achieved the top performance with Pearson's correlation coefficient ($R_p$)being 0.858. Most importantly, MathDL is validated on a carefully curatedSARS-CoV-2 inhibitor dataset with the averaged $R_p$ as high as 0.751, whichendows the reliability of the present binding affinity prediction.

Biswal;Areejit Samal;Presently, there are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19 whichhas spread to over 200 countries and is responsible for over 3,65,000 deathsworldwide. Recent studies have shown that two human proteases, TMPRSS2 andcathepsin L, play a key role in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly,inhibitors of these proteases were shown to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here,we perform virtual screening of 14010 phytochemicals produced by Indianmedicinal plants to identify natural product inhibitors of TMPRSS2 andcathepsin L. We built a homology model of TMPRSS2 as an experimentallydetermined structure is not available. AutoDock Vina was used to performmolecular docking of phytochemicals against TMPRSS2 model structure andcathepsin L crystal structure. Potential phytochemical inhibitors were filteredby comparing their docked binding energies with those of known inhibitors ofTMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Further, the ligand binding site residues andnon-covalent protein-ligand interactions were used as an additional filter toidentify phytochemical inhibitors that either bind to or form interactions withresidues important for the specificity of the target proteases. We haveidentified 96 inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and 9 inhibitors of cathepsin L amongphytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants. The top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 areEdgeworoside C, Adlumidine and Qingdainone, and of cathepsin L is Ararobinol.Interestingly, several herbal sources of identified phytochemical inhibitorshave antiviral or anti-inflammatory use in traditional medicine. Further invitro and in vivo testing is needed before clinical trials of the promisingphytochemical inhibitors identified here.;/abs/2006.00652

Given the high social,educational, psychological, and economic costs of NPIs, authorities tune them,alternatively tightening up or relaxing rules, with the result that, in effect,a relatively flat infection rate results. For example, during the summer inparts of the United States, daily infection numbers dropped to a plateau. Thispaper approaches NPI tuning as a control-theoretic problem, starting from asimple dynamic model for social distancing based on the classical SIR epidemicsmodel. Using a singular-perturbation approach, the plateau becomes aQuasi-Steady-State (QSS) of a reduced two-dimensional SIR model regulated byadaptive dynamic feedback. It is shown that the QSS can be assigned and it isglobally asymptotically stable. Interestingly, the dynamic model for socialdistancing can be interpreted as a nonlinear integral controller. Problems ofdata fitting and parameter identifiability are also studied for this model. Thepaper also discusses how this simple model allows for meaningful study of theeffect of population size, vaccinations, and the emergence of second waves.;/abs/2103.08488

Immune response in SARS-CoV-2 epidemics: A fractional-order model";(Submitted on 16 Mar 2021 (;João Paulo Simões Maurício de Carvalho;;;;;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highlycontagious virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19). Thesymptoms of CoViD-19 are essentially reflected in the respiratory system,although other organs are also affected. More than 2.4 million people have diedworldwide due to this disease. Despite CoViD-19 vaccines are already beingadministered, alternative treatments that address the immunopathology of theinfection are still needed. For this end, a deeper knowledge on how our immunesystem responds to SARS-CoV-2 is required. In this study, we propose anon-integer order model to understand the dynamics of cytotoxic T lymphocytesin the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We calculated the basic reproduction number andanalysed the values of the model parameters in order to understand which onesinhibit or enhance the progression of the infection. Numerical simulations wereperformed for different values of the order of the fractional derivative andfor different proliferation functions of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.;/abs/2103.09053

Age-Stratified COVID-19 Spread Analysis and Vaccination: A Multitype  Random Network Approach";(Submitted on 18 Mar 2021);Xianhao Chen;Guangyu Zhu;Lan Zhang;Yuguang Fang;Linke Guo;The risk for severe illness and mortality from COVID-19 significantlyincreases with age. As a result, age-stratified modeling for COVID-19 dynamicsis the key to study how to reduce hospitalizations and mortality from COVID-19.By taking advantage of network theory, we develop an age-stratified epidemicmodel for COVID-19 in complex contact networks. Specifically, we present anextension of standard SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed)compartmental model, called age-stratified SEAHIR(susceptible-exposedasymptomatic-hospitalized-infectious-removed) model, tocapture the spread of COVID-19 over multitype random networks with generaldegree distributions. We derive several key epidemiological metrics and thenpropose an age-stratified vaccination strategy to decrease the mortality andhospitalizations. Through extensive study, we discover that the outcome ofvaccination prioritization depends on the reproduction number R0. Specifically,the elderly should be prioritized only when R0 is relatively high. If ongoingintervention policies, such as universal masking, could suppress R0 at arelatively low level, prioritizing the high-transmission age group (i.e.,adults aged 20-39) is most effective to reduce both mortality andhospitalizations. These conclusions provide useful recommendations forage-based vaccination prioritization for COVID-19.;/abs/2103.10012

Uncertainty Estimation in SARS-CoV-2 B-cell Epitope Prediction for  Vaccine Development";(Submitted on 20 Mar 2021);Bhargab Ghoshal;Biraja Ghoshal;Stephen Swift;Allan Tucker;;B-cell epitopes play a key role in stimulating B-cells, triggering theprimary immune response which results in antibody production as well as theestablishment of long-term immunity in the form of memory cells. Consequently,being able to accurately predict appropriate linear B-cell epitope regionswould pave the way for the development of new protein-based vaccines. Knowinghow much confidence there is in a prediction is also essential for gainingclinicians' trust in the technology. In this article, we propose a calibrateduncertainty estimation in deep learning to approximate variational Bayesianinference using MC-DropWeights to predict epitope regions using the data fromthe immune epitope database. Having applied this onto SARS-CoV-2, it can morereliably predict B-cell epitopes than standard methods. This will be able toidentify safe and effective vaccine candidates against Covid-19.;/abs/2103.11214

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein is vulnerable to moderate electric fields";(Submitted on 23 Mar 2021);Claudia R. Arbeitman;Pablo Rojas;Pedro Ojeda-May;Martin E. Garcia;;Most of the ongoing projects aimed at the development of specific therapiesand vaccines against COVID-19 use the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein as the maintarget [1-3]. The binding of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor (ACE2) ofthe host cell constitutes the first and key step for virus entry. During thisprocess, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein plays an essentialrole, since it contains the receptor binding motif (RBM), responsible for thedocking to the receptor. So far, mostly biochemical methods are being tested inorder to prevent binding of the virus to ACE2 [4]. Here we show, with the helpof atomistic simulations, that external electric fields of easily achievableand moderate strengths can dramatically destabilise the S protein, inducinglong-lasting structural damage. One striking field-induced conformationalchange occurs at the level of the recognition loop L3 of the RBD where twoparallel beta sheets, believed to be responsible for a high affinity to ACE2[5], undergo a change into an unstructured coil, which exhibits almost nobinding possibilities to the ACE2 receptor (Figure 1a). Remarkably, while thestructural flexibility of S allows the virus to improve its probability ofentering the cell, it is also the origin of the surprising vulnerability of Supon application of electric fields of strengths at least two orders ofmagnitude smaller than those required for damaging most proteins. Our findingssuggest the existence of a clean physical method to weaken the SARS-CoV-2 viruswithout further biochemical processing. Moreover, the effect could be used forinfection prevention purposes and also to develop technologies for in-vitrostructural manipulation of S. Since the method is largely unspecific, it can besuitable for application to mutations in S, to other proteins of SARS-CoV-2 andin general to membrane proteins of other virus types.;/abs/2103.12733

A multi-layer network model to assess school opening policies during the  COVID-19 vaccination campaign";(Submitted on 2 Mar 2021);Christian Bongiorno;Lorenzo Zino;;;;We propose a multi-layer network model for the spread of COVID-19 thataccounts for interactions within the family, between schoolmates, and casualcontacts in the population. We utilize the proposed model-calibrated onepidemiological and demographic data-to investigate current questionsconcerning the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) duringthe vaccination campaign. Specifically, we consider scenarios in which the mostfragile population has already received the vaccine, and we focus our analysison the role of schools as drivers of the contagions and on the implementationof targeted intervention policies oriented to children and their families. Weperform our analysis by means of a campaign of Monte Carlo simulations. Ourfindings suggest that, in a phase with NPIs enacted but in-person education,children play a key role in the spreading of COVID-19. Interestingly, we showthat children's testing might be an important tool to flatten the epidemiccurve, in particular when combined with enacting temporary online education forclasses in which infected students are detected. Finally, we test a vaccinationstrategy that prioritizes the members of large families and we demonstrate itsgood performance. We believe that our modeling framework and our findings couldbe of help for public health authorities for planning their current and futureinterventions, as well as to increase preparedness for future epidemicoutbreaks.;/abs/2103.12519

Robust Pandemic Control Synthesis with Formal Specifications: A Case  Study on COVID-19 Pandemic";(Submitted on 26 Mar 2021);Zhe Xu;Xiaoming Duan;;;;"Pandemics can bring a range of devastating consequences to public health andthe world economy. Identifying the most effective control strategies has beenthe imperative task all around the world. Various public health controlstrategies have been proposed and tested against pandemic diseases (e.g.,COVID-19). We study two specific pandemic control models: the susceptible,exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination control; and theSEIR model with shield immunity control. We express the pandemic controlrequirement in metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas. We then develop aniterative approach for synthesizing the optimal control strategies with MTLspecifications. We provide simulation results in two different scenarios forrobust control of the COVID-19 pandemic: one for vaccination control, andanother for shield immunity control, with the model parameters estimated fromdata in Lombardy, Italy. The results show that the proposed synthesis approachcan generate control inputs such that the time-varying numbers of individualsin each category (e.g., infectious, immune) satisfy the MTL specifications withrobustness against initial state and parameter uncertainties.";/abs/2103.14262

Emergence of more contagious COVID-19 variants from the coevolution of  viruses and policy interventions";(Submitted on 26 Mar 2021);Aymeric Vie;;;;;At the end of 2020, policy responses to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have beenshaken by the emergence of virus variants. The emergence of these morecontagious, more severe, or even vaccine-resistant strains have challengedworldwide policy interventions. Anticipating the emergence of these mutationsto plan ahead adequate policies, and understanding how human behaviors mayaffect the evolution of viruses by coevolution, are key challenges. In thisarticle, we propose coevolution with genetic algorithms (GAs) as a credibleapproach to model this relationship, highlighting its implications, potentialand challenges. We present a dual GA model in which both viruses aiming forsurvival and policy measures aiming at minimising infection rates in thepopulation, competitively evolve. Simulation runs reproduce the emergence ofmore contagious variants, and identifies the evolution of policy responses as adeterminant cause of this phenomenon. This coevolution opens new possibilitiesto visualise the impact of governments interventions not only on outbreakdynamics, but also on its evolution, to improve the efficacy of policies.;/abs/2103.14366

Inferring the main drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility";(Submitted on 28 Mar 2021);Marko Djordjevic;Igor Salom;Sofija Markovic;Andjela Rodic;Ognjen Milicevic;Identifying the main environmental drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility inthe population is crucial for understanding current and potential futureoutbursts of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. To address this problem,we concentrate on basic reproduction number $R_0$, which is not sensitive totesting coverage and represents transmissibility in an absence of socialdistancing and in a completely susceptible population. While many variables maypotentially influence $R_0$, a high correlation between these variables mayobscure the result interpretation. Consequently, we combine Principal ComponentAnalysis with feature selection methods from several regression-basedapproaches to identify the main demographic and meteorological drivers behind$R_0$. We robustly obtain that country's wealth/development (GDP per capita orHuman Development Index) is by far the most important R0 predictor, probablybeing a good proxy for the overall contact frequency in a population. This maineffect is modulated by built-up area per capita (crowdedness in indoor space),onset of infection (likely related to increased awareness of infection risks),net migration, unhealthy living lifestyle/conditions including pollution,seasonality, and possibly BCG vaccination prevalence. Also, we show thatseveral variables that significantly correlate with transmissibility do notdirectly influence $R_0$ or affect it differently than suggested by naiveanalysis.;/abs/2103.15123

How fast must vaccination campaigns proceed in order to beat rising  Covid-19 infection numbers?";(Submitted on 29 Mar 2021 (;Claudius Gros;Daniel Gros;;;;We derive an analytic expression describing how health costs and death countsof the Covid-19 pandemic change over time as vaccination proceeds. Meanwhile,the disease may continue to spread exponentially unless checked by NonPharmacological Interventions (NPI). The key factors are that the mortalityrisk from a Covid-19 infection increases exponentially with age and that thesizes of age cohorts decrease linearly at the top of the population pyramid.Taking these factors into account, we derive an expression for a criticalthreshold, which determines the minimal speed a vaccination campaign needs tohave in order to be able to keep fatalities from rising. Younger countries withfast vaccination campaigns find it substantially easier to reach this thresholdthan countries with aged population and slower vaccination. We find that for EUcountries it will take some time to reach this threshold, given that the new,now dominant, mutations, have a significantly higher infection rate. Theurgency of accelerating vaccination is increased by early evidence that the newstrains also have a higher mortality risk. We also find that protecting theover 60 years old, which constitute one quarter of the EU population, wouldreduce the loss of live by 95 percent.;/abs/2103.15544

We focus on 4765 uniquepopular tweets in English or Italian about COVID-19 vaccines between 12/2020and 03/2021. One popular English tweet was liked up to 495,000 times, stressinghow popular tweets affected cognitively massive populations. We investigateboth text and multimedia in tweets, building a knowledge graph ofsyntactic/semantic associations in messages including visual features andindicating how online users framed social discourse mostly around the logisticsof vaccine distribution. The English semantic frame of ""vaccine"" was highlypolarised between trust/anticipation (towards the vaccine as a scientific assetsaving lives) and anger/sadness (mentioning critical issues with doseadministering). Semantic associations with ""vaccine,"" ""hoax"" and conspiratorialjargon indicated the persistence of conspiracy theories and vaccines inmassively read English posts (absent in Italian messages). The image analysisfound that popular tweets with images of people wearing face masks usedlanguage lacking the trust and joy found in tweets showing people with nomasks, indicating a negative affect attributed to face covering in socialdiscourse. A behavioural analysis revealed a tendency for users to sharecontent eliciting joy, sadness and disgust and to like less sad messages,highlighting an interplay between emotions and content diffusion beyondsentiment. With the AstraZeneca vaccine being suspended in mid March 2021,""Astrazeneca"" was associated with trustful language driven by experts, butpopular Italian tweets framed ""vaccine"" by crucially replacing earlier levelsof trust with deep sadness.

We extracted a corpus ofTwitter posts related to COVID-19 vaccination and created two classes oflexical categories - Emotions and Influencing factors. Using unsupervised wordembeddings, we tracked the longitudinal change in the latent space of thelexical categories in five countries with strong vaccine roll-out programs,i.e. India, USA, Brazil, UK, and Australia. Nearly 600 thousand vaccine-relatedtweets from the United States and India were analyzed for an overallunderstanding of the situation around the world for the time period of 8 monthsfrom June 2020 to January 2021. Cosine distance between lexical categories wasused to create similarity networks and modules using community detectionalgorithms.

Initially, weestablish the positivity and boundedness of the solutions of the model andcalculate the basic reproduction number. We then formulate an optimal controlproblem with vaccination and treatment as control variables. Optimalvaccination and treatment policies are analysed for different values of theweight constant associated with the cost of vaccination and differenttransmissibility levels. Findings from these suggested that the combinedstrategies(vaccination and treatment) worked best in minimizing the infectionand disease induced mortality. In order to reduce COVID-19 infection andCOVID-19 induced deaths to maximum, it was observed that optimal controlstrategy should be prioritized to population with age greater than 40 years.Not much difference was found between individual strategies and combinedstrategies in case of mild epidemic ($R_0 \in (0, 2)$). For higher values of$R_0 (R_0 \in (2, 10))$ the combined strategies was found to be best in termsof minimizing the overall infection. The infection curves varying theefficacies of the vaccines were also analysed and it was found that higherefficacy of the vaccine resulted in lesser number of infection and COVIDinduced death.;/abs/2102.09802

Epidemic spreading under pathogen evolution";(Submitted on 19 Feb 2021 (;Xiyun Zhang;Zhongyuan Ruan;Muhua Zheng;Jie Zhou;Stefano Boccaletti;Battling a widespread pandemic is an arms race between our mitigationefforts, e.g., social distancing or vaccination, and the pathogen's evolvingpersistence. This is being observed firsthand during the current COVID-19crisis, as novel mutations challenge our global vaccination race. To addressthis, we introduce here a general framework to model epidemic spreading underpathogen evolution, finding that mutations can fundamentally alter theprojection of the spread. Specifically, we detect a new pandemic phase - themutated phase - in which, despite the fact that the pathogen is initiallynon-pandemic (R0 < 1), it may still spread due to the emergence of a criticalmutation. The boundaries of this phase portray a balance between the epidemicand the evolutionary time-scales. If the mutation rate is too low, the pathogenprevalence decays prior to the appearance of a critical mutation. On the otherhand, if mutations are too rapid, the pathogen evolution becomes volatile and,once again, it fails to spread. Between these two extremes, however, we observea broad range of conditions in which an initially sub-pandemic pathogen willeventually gain prevalence. This is especially relevant during vaccination,which creates, as it progresses, increasing selection pressure towardsvaccine-resistance. To overcome this, we show that vaccination campaigns mustbe accompanied by fierce mitigation efforts, to suppress the potential rise ofa resistant mutant strain.;/abs/2102.11066

Our modeling approach is based on asimple mechanistic Kermack-McKendrick-type model. To quantify the effect ofNPIs, we perform a monthly Bayesian inference using officially published data.The results suggest that in the absence of the sanitary measures, thecumulative number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths would have beenat least twice the official number. Moreover, for low vaccine coverage levels,relaxing NPIs may dramatically increase the disease burden; therefore, safetymeasures are of critical importance at the early stages of vaccination. Thesimulations also suggest that it may be more desirable to employ a vaccine withlow efficacy but reach a high coverage than a vaccine with high effectivenessbut low coverage levels. This supports the hypothesis that single doses to moreindividuals will be more effective than two doses for every person.";/abs/2102.11071

WLAN-Log-Based Superspreader Detection in the COVID-19 Pandemic";(Submitted on 22 Feb 2021 (;Cheng Zhang;Yunze Pan;Yunqi Zhang;Adam C. Champion;Zhaohui Shen;"Identifying ""superspreaders"" of disease is a pressing concern for societyduring pandemics such as COVID-19. Superspreaders represent a group of peoplewho have much more social contacts than others. The widespread deployment ofWLAN infrastructure enables non-invasive contact tracing via people'subiquitous mobile devices. This technology offers promise for detectingsuperspreaders. In this paper, we propose a general framework forWLAN-log-based superspreader detection. In our framework, we first use WLANlogs to construct contact graphs by jointly considering human symmetric andasymmetric interactions. Next, we adopt three vertex centrality measurementsover the contact graphs to generate three groups of superspreader candidates.Finally, we leverage SEIR simulation to determine groups of superspreadersamong these candidates, who are the most critical individuals for the spread ofdisease based on the simulation results. We have implemented our framework andevaluate it over a WLAN dataset with 41 million log entries from a large-scaleuniversity. Our evaluation shows superspreaders exist on university campuses.They change over the first few weeks of a semester, but stabilize throughoutthe rest of the term. The data also demonstrate that both symmetric andasymmetric contact tracing can discover superspreaders, but the latter performsbetter with daily contact graphs. Further, the evaluation shows no consistentdifferences among three vertex centrality measures for long-term (i.e., weekly)contact graphs, which necessitates the inclusion of SEIR simulation in ourframework. We believe our proposed framework and these results may providetimely guidance for public health administrators regarding effective testing,intervention, and vaccination policies.";/abs/2102.11171

The Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination Delay: A Modelling Study for Chicago  and NYC Data";(Submitted on 24 Feb 2021);Vinicius V. L. Albani;Jennifer Loria;Eduardo Massad;Jorge P. Zubelli;;Background: By the beginning of December 2020, some vaccines against COVID-19already presented efficacy and security, which qualify them to be used in massvaccination campaigns. Thus, setting up strategies of vaccination becamecrucial to control the COVID19 pandemic. Methods: We use daily COVID-19 reportsfrom Chicago and NYC from 01-Mar2020 to 28- Nov-2020 to estimate the parametersof an SEIR-like epidemiological model that accounts for different severitylevels. To achieve data adherent predictions, we let the model parameters to betime-dependent. The model is used to forecast different vaccination scenarios,where the campaign starts at different dates, from 01-Oct-2020 to 01-Apr-2021.To generate realistic scenarios, disease control strategies are implementedwhenever the number of predicted daily hospitalizations reaches a presetthreshold. Results: The model reproduces the empirical data with remarkableaccuracy. Delaying the vaccination severely affects the mortality,hospitalization, and recovery projections. In Chicago, the disease spread wasunder control, reducing the mortality increment as the start of the vaccinationwas postponed. In NYC, the number of cases was increasing, thus, the estimatedmodel predicted a much larger impact, despite the implementation of contentionmeasures. The earlier the vaccination campaign begins, the larger is itspotential impact in reducing the COVID-19 cases, as well as in thehospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, the rate at which cases,hospitalizations and deaths increase with the delay in the vaccinationbeginning strongly depends on the shape of the incidence of infection in eachcity.;/abs/2102.12299

Estimating Vaccine Efficacy Over Time After a Randomized Study is  Unblinded";(Submitted on 24 Feb 2021);Anastasios A. Tsiatis;Marie Davidian;;;;The COVID-19 pandemic due to the novel coronavirus SARS CoV-2 has inspiredremarkable breakthroughs in development of vaccines against the virus and thelaunch of several phase 3 vaccine trials in Summer 2020 to evaluate vaccineefficacy (VE). Trials of vaccine candidates using mRNA delivery systemsdeveloped by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have shown substantial VEs of 94-95%,leading the US Food and Drug Administration to issue Emergency UseAuthorizations and subsequent widespread administration of the vaccines. As thetrials continue, a key issue is the possibility that VE may wane over time.Ethical considerations dictate that all trial participants be unblinded andthose randomized to placebo be offered vaccine, leading to trial protocolamendments specifying unblinding strategies. Crossover of placebo subjects tovaccine complicates inference on waning of VE. We focus on the particularfeatures of the Moderna trial and propose a statistical framework based on apotential outcomes formulation within which we develop methods for inference onwhether or not VE wanes over time and estimation of VE at any post-vaccinationtime. The framework clarifies assumptions made regarding individual- andpopulation-level phenomena and acknowledges the possibility that subjects whoare more or less likely to become infected may be crossed over to vaccinedifferentially over time. The principles of the framework can be adaptedstraightforwardly to other trials.;/abs/2102.13103

Modelling SARS-CoV-2 coevolution with genetic algorithms";(Submitted on 24 Feb 2021);Aymeric Vie;;;;;"At the end of 2020, policy responses to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have beenshaken by the emergence of virus variants, impacting public health and policymeasures worldwide. The emergence of these strains suspected to be morecontagious, more severe, or even resistant to antibodies and vaccines, seem tohave taken by surprise health services and policymakers, struggling to adapt tothe new variants constraints. Anticipating the emergence of these mutations toplan ahead adequate policies, and understanding how human behaviors may affectthe evolution of viruses by coevolution, are key challenges. In this article,we propose coevolution with genetic algorithms (GAs) as a credible approach tomodel this relationship, highlighting its implications, potential andchallenges. Because of their qualities of exploration of large spaces ofpossible solutions, capacity to generate novelty, and natural genetic focus,GAs are relevant for this issue. We present a dual GA model in which bothviruses aiming for survival and policy measures aiming at minimising infectionrates in the population, competitively evolve. This artificial coevolutionsystem may offer us a laboratory to ""debug"" our current policy measures,identify the weaknesses of our current strategies, and anticipate the evolutionof the virus to plan ahead relevant policies. It also constitutes a decisiveopportunity to develop new genetic algorithms capable of simulating much morecomplex objects. We highlight some structural innovations for GAs for thatvirus evolution context that may carry promising developments in evolutionarycomputation, artificial life and AI.";/abs/2102.12365

Potential benefits of delaying the second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose";(Submitted on 26 Feb 2021);Benjamin F. Maier;Angelique Burdinski;Annika H. Rose;Frank Schlosser;David Hinrichs;Vaccination against COVID-19 with the recently approved mRNA vaccinesBNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) is currently underway in alarge number of countries. However, high incidence rates and rapidly spreadingSARS-CoV-2 variants are concerning. In combination with acute supply deficitsin Europe in early 2021, the question arises of whether stretching the vaccine,for instance by delaying the second dose, can make a significant contributionto preventing deaths, despite associated risks such as lower vaccine efficacy,the potential emergence of escape mutants, enhancement, waning immunity,reduced social acceptance of off-label vaccination, and liability shifts. Aquantitative epidemiological assessment of risks and benefits of non-standardvaccination protocols remains elusive. To clarify the situation and to providea quantitative epidemiological foundation we develop a stochasticepidemiological model that integrates specific vaccine rollout protocols into arisk-group structured infectious disease dynamical model. Using the situationand conditions in Germany as a reference system, we show that delaying thesecond vaccine dose is expected to prevent deaths in the four to five digitrange, should the incidence resurge. We show that this considerable publichealth benefit relies on the fact that both mRNA vaccines provide substantialprotection against severe COVID-19 and death beginning 12 to 14 days after thefirst dose. The benefits of protocol change are attenuated should vaccinecompliance decrease substantially. To quantify the impact of protocol change onvaccination adherence we performed a large-scale online survey. We find that,in Germany, changing vaccination protocols may lead to small reductions invaccination intention. In sum, we therefore expect the benefits of a strategychange to remain substantial and stable.;/abs/2102.13600

Optimal vaccination strategies for COVID-19 based on dynamical social  networks with real-time updating";(Submitted on 19 Feb 2021);Sibo Cheng;Arcucci Rossella;Christopher C. Pain;Yi-Ke Guo;;Vaccination strategy is crucial in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic.Since the supply is limited, contact network-based interventions can be mostpowerful to set an optimal strategy by identifying high-risk individuals orcommunities. However, due to the high dimension, only partial and noisy networkinformation can be available in practice, especially for dynamical systemswhere the contact networks are highly time-variant. Furthermore, numerousmutations of SARS-CoV-2 impact considerably the current infectious probability,requiring real-time network updating algorithms. In this study, we propose asequential network updating approach based on data assimilation techniques tocombine different sources of temporal information. We then prioritise theindividuals with high-degree or high-centrality, obtained from the assimilatednetworks, for vaccination. The assimilation-based approach is compared with thestandard method (based on partially observed networks) and a random selectionstrategy in terms of vaccination effectiveness in a SIR model. The numericalcomparison is first carried out using real-world face-to-face dynamicalnetworks collected in a high school, following by sequential multi-layernetworks, generated relying on the Barabasi-Albert model emulating thedepartment of Computing at Imperial College London in the UK as an example.;/abs/2103.00485

T. Bezerra;Elizabeth F. Wanner;With the logistic challenges faced by most countries for the production,distribution, and application of vaccines for the novel coronavirusdisease~(COVID-19), social distancing~(SD) remains the most tangible approachto mitigate the spread of the virus. To assist SD monitoring, several techcompanies have made publicly available anonymized mobility data. In this work,we conduct a multi-objective mobility reduction rate comparison between thefirst and second COVID-19 waves in several localities from America and Europeusing Google community mobility reports~(CMR) data. Through multi-dimensionalvisualization, we are able to compare in a Pareto-compliant way the reductionin mobility from the different lockdown periods for each locality selected,simultaneously considering all place categories provided in CMR. In addition,our analysis comprises a 56-day lockdown period for each locality and COVID-19wave, which we analyze both as 56-day periods and as 14-day consecutivewindows. Results vary considerably as a function of the locality considered,particularly when the temporal evolution of the mobility reduction isconsidered. We thus discuss each locality individually, relating socialdistancing measures and the reduction observed.;/abs/2103.00535

Modeling and prediction of COVID-19 in the United States considering  population behavior and vaccination";(Submitted on 1 Mar 2021);Thomas Usherwood;Zachary LaJoie;Vikas Srivastava;;;"COVID-19 has devastated the entire global community. Vaccines present anopportunity to mitigate the pandemic; however, the effect of vaccinationcoupled with the behavioral response of the population is not well understood.We propose a model that incorporates two important dynamically varyingpopulation behaviors: level of caution and sense of safety. Level of cautionincreases with the number of infectious cases, while an increasing sense ofsafety with increased vaccination lowers precautionary behaviors. To the bestof our knowledge, this is the first model that can effectively reproduce thecomplete time history of COVID-19 infections for various regions of the UnitedStates and provides relatable measures of dynamic changes in the populationbehavior and disease transmission rates. We propose a parameter d_I as a directmeasure of a population's caution against an infectious disease, that can beobtained from the ongoing new infectious cases. The model provides a method forquantitative measure of critical infectious disease attributes for a populationincluding highest disease transmission rate, effective disease transmissionrate, and disease related precautionary behavior. We predict future COVID-19pandemic trends in the United States accounting for vaccine rollout andbehavioral response. Although a high rate of vaccination is critical to quicklyend the pandemic, we find that a return towards pre-pandemic social behaviordue to increased sense of safety during vaccine deployment, can cause analarming surge in infections. Our results indicate that at the current rate ofvaccination, the new infection cases for COVID-19 in the United States willapproach zero by the end of August 2021.

The spread of COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted thehuman mobility patterns such as daily transportation-related behavior of thepublic. There is a requirement to understand the disease spread patterns andits routes among neighboring individuals for the timely implementation ofcorrective measures at the required placement. To increase the effectiveness ofcontact tracing, countries across the globe are leveraging advancements inmobile technology and Internet of Things (IoT) to aid traditional manualcontact tracing to track individuals who have come in close contact withidentified COVID-19 patients. Even as the first administration of vaccinesbegins in 2021, the COVID-19 management strategy will continue to bemulti-pronged for the foreseeable future with digital contact tracing being avital component of the response along with the use of preventive measures suchas social distancing and the use of face masks. After some months of deploymentof digital contact tracing technology, deeper insights into the merits ofvarious approaches and the usability, privacy, and ethical trade-offs involvedare emerging. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of digitalcontact tracing solutions in terms of their methodologies and technologies inthe light of the new data emerging about international experiences ofdeployments of digital contact tracing technology.

COVID-19 vaccination strategies on dynamic networks";(Submitted on 2 Mar 2021);Quoc Huy Nguyen;Jessica Liebig;Md Shahzamal;Bernard Mans;Raja Jurdak;Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become aglobal public health concern. A great proportion of the world needs to bevaccinated in order to stop the rapid spread of the disease. In addition toprioritising vulnerable sections of the population to receive the vaccine, anideal degree-based vaccination strategy uses fine-grained contact networks toprioritise vaccine recipients. This strategy is costly and impractical due tothe enormous amount of specific contact information needed. It also does notcapture indirect famine or aerosol-based transmission. We recently proposed anew vaccination strategy called Individual's Movement-based Vaccination (IMV),which takes into account both direct and indirect transmission and is based onthe types of places people visit. IMV was shown to be cost-efficient in thecase of influenza-like diseases. This paper studies the application of IMV toCOVID-19 using its documented transmission parameters. We conduct large scalecomputer simulations based on a city-wide empirical mobility dataset toevaluate the performance and practicability of the strategy. Results show thatthe proposed strategy achieves nearly five times the efficiency of randomvaccination and performs comparably to the degree-based strategy, whilesignificantly reducing the data collection requirements.;/abs/2103.01957

Only a small number ofcoronaviruses are known to infect humans, and only two are associated with thesevere outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute respiratorysyndrome-related coronavirus, a closely related species of SARS-CoV-2 thatemerged in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,which emerged in 2012. Both of these previous epidemics were controlled fairlyrapidly through public health measures, and no vaccines or robust therapeuticinterventions were identified. However, previous insights into the immuneresponse to coronaviruses gained during the outbreaks of severe acuterespiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) haveproved beneficial to identifying approaches to the treatment and prophylaxis ofnovel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Resource Distribution Under Spatiotemporal Uncertainty of Disease  Spread: Stochastic versus Robust Approaches";(Submitted on 7 Mar 2021);Beste Basciftci;Xian Yu;Siqian Shen;;;Speeding up testing and vaccination is essential to controlling thecoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has became a global healthcrisis. In this paper, we develop mathematical frameworks for optimizinglocations of distribution centers and plans for distributing resources such astest kits and vaccines under spatiotemporal uncertainties of infection anddemand trends. We aim to balance between operational cost (including costs ofdeploying facilities, shipping and storage) and quality of service (reflectedby delivery speed and demand coverage), while ensuring equity and fairness ofresource distribution based on historical infection data and demographics ofestimated demand. Using weighted multiple objectives, we formulate a stochasticinteger program and also seek robust solutions against the distributionalambiguity of demand. For the latter, we propose a distributionally robustoptimization model using a moment ambiguity set, and derive monolithicreformulations depending on specific forms of this set. We compare differentapproaches by solving instances generated using real COVID-19 infection datafor distributing vaccines and test kits over the United States and the State ofMichigan, respectively. We demonstrate results over distinct phases of thepandemic to estimate cost and speed of resource distribution depending on thescales and coverage. approaches always outperform the deterministic one. If weprioritize the worst-case performance in terms of unmet demand (i.e., untestedor unvaccinated people who qualify), then the distributionally robust approachis preferred despite of its higher overall cost. Nevertheless, the stochasticprogramming approach can provide an intermediate plan under budgetaryrestrictions without significant compromises in demand coverage.;/abs/2103.04266

The impact of state capacity on the cross-country variations in COVID-19  vaccination rates";(Submitted on 8 Mar 2021);Dragan Tevdovski;Petar Jolakoski;Viktor Stojkoski;;;The initial period of vaccination shows strong heterogeneity betweencountries' vaccinations rollout, both in the terms of the start of thevaccination process and in the dynamics of the number of people that arevaccinated. A predominant thesis in the ongoing debate on the drivers of thisobserved heterogeneity is that a key determinant of the swift and extensivevaccine rollout is state capacity. Here, we utilize two measures that quantifydifferent aspects of the state capacity: i) the external capacity (measuredthrough the soft power and the economic power of the country) and ii) theinternal capacity (measured via the country's government effectiveness) andinvestigate their relationship with the coronavirus vaccination outcome in theinitial period (up to 30th January 2021). By using data on 189 countries and atwo-step Heckman approach, we find that the economic power of the country andits soft power are robust determinants of whether a country has started withthe vaccination process. In addition, the government effectiveness is a keyfactor that determines vaccine roll-out. Altogether, our findings are in linewith the hypothesis that state capacity determines the observed heterogeneitybetween countries in the initial period of COVID-19 vaccines rollout.;/abs/2103.04981

Using principledstatistical approaches, we determined differential features of BCRs associatedwith different disease severity. We identified 38 significantly expanded clonallineages shared among patients as candidates for specific responses toSARS-CoV-2. Using single-cell sequencing, we verified reactivity of BCRs sharedamong individuals to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Moreover, we identified naturalemergence of a BCR with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in anumber of patients. Our results provide important insights for development ofrational therapies and vaccines against COVID-19.;/abs/2007.06762

Blockchain Meets COVID-19: A Framework for Contact Information Sharing  and Risk Notification System";(Submitted on 20 Jul 2020);Jinyue Song;Tianbo Gu;Xiaotao Feng;Yunjie Ge;Prasant Mohapatra;COVID-19 causes a global epidemic infection, which is the most severeinfection disaster in human history. In the absence of particular medicationand vaccines, tracing and isolating the source of infection is the best optionto slow the spread of the virus and reduce infection and death rates among thepopulation. There are three main obstacles in the process of tracing theinfection: 1) Patient's electronic health record is stored in a traditionalcentralized database that could be stolen and tampered with the infection data,2) The confidential personal identity of the infected user may be revealed to athird party or organization, 3) Existing infection tracing systems do not traceinfections from multiple dimensions. Either the system is location-based orindividual-based tracing. In this work, we propose a global COVID-19information sharing system that utilizes the Blockchain, Smart Contract, andBluetooth technologies. The proposed system unifies location-based andBluetooth-based contact tracing services into the Blockchain platform, wherethe automatically executed smart contracts are deployed so that users can getconsistent and non-tamperable virus trails. The anonymous functionalityprovided by the Blockchain and Bluetooth technology protects the user'sidentity privacy. With our proposed analysis formula for estimating theprobability of infection, users can take measures to protect themselves inadvance. We also implement a prototype system to demonstrate the feasibilityand effectiveness of our approach.;/abs/2007.10529

Health, Psychosocial, and Social issues emanating from COVID-19 pandemic  based on Social Media Comments using Natural Language Processing";(Submitted on 23 Jul 2020);Oladapo Oyebode;Chinenye Ndulue;Ashfaq Adib;Dinesh Mulchandani;Banuchitra Suruliraj;The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis that affects manyaspects of human lives. In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, severalbehavioural change and policy initiatives, such as physical distancing, havebeen implemented to control the spread of the coronavirus. Social media datacan reveal public perceptions toward how governments and health agencies acrossthe globe are handling the pandemic, as well as the impact of the disease onpeople regardless of their geographic locations in line with various factorsthat hinder or facilitate the efforts to control the spread of the pandemicglobally. This paper aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic onpeople globally using social media data. We apply natural language processing(NLP) and thematic analysis to understand public opinions, experiences, andissues with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media data. First, wecollect over 47 million COVID-19-related comments from Twitter, Facebook,YouTube, and three online discussion forums. Second, we perform datapreprocessing which involves applying NLP techniques to clean and prepare thedata for automated theme extraction. Third, we apply context-aware NLP approachto extract meaningful keyphrases or themes from over 1 million randomlyselected comments, as well as compute sentiment scores for each theme andassign sentiment polarity based on the scores using lexicon-based technique.Fourth, we categorize related themes into broader themes. A total of 34negative themes emerged, out of which 15 are health-related issues,psychosocial issues, and social issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic fromthe public perspective. In addition, 20 positive themes emerged from ourresults. Finally, we recommend interventions that can help address the negativeissues based on the positive themes and other remedial ideas rooted inresearch.;/abs/2007.12144

Modern Hopfield Networks and Attention for Immune Repertoire  Classification";(Submitted on 16 Jul 2020);Michael Widrich;Bernhard Schäfl;Hubert Ramsauer;Milena Pavlović;Lukas Gruber;A central mechanism in machine learning is to identify, store, and recognizepatterns. How to learn, access, and retrieve such patterns is crucial inHopfield networks and the more recent transformer architectures. We show thatthe attention mechanism of transformer architectures is actually the updaterule of modern Hopfield networks that can store exponentially many patterns. Weexploit this high storage capacity of modern Hopfield networks to solve achallenging multiple instance learning (MIL) problem in computational biology:immune repertoire classification. Accurate and interpretable machine learningmethods solving this problem could pave the way towards new vaccines andtherapies, which is currently a very relevant research topic intensified by theCOVID-19 crisis. Immune repertoire classification based on the vast number ofimmunosequences of an individual is a MIL problem with an unprecedentedlymassive number of instances, two orders of magnitude larger than currentlyconsidered problems, and with an extremely low witness rate. In this work, wepresent our novel method DeepRC that integrates transformer-like attention, orequivalently modern Hopfield networks, into deep learning architectures formassive MIL such as immune repertoire classification. We demonstrate thatDeepRC outperforms all other methods with respect to predictive performance onlarge-scale experiments, including simulated and real-world virus infectiondata, and enables the extraction of sequence motifs that are connected to agiven disease class.

Impact of urban structure on COVID-19 spread";(Submitted on 30 Jul 2020);Javier Aguilar;Aleix Bassolas;Gourab Ghoshal;Surendra Hazarie;Alec Kirkley;The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis of massive scale.Prior research indicates that human mobility is one of the key factors involvedin viral spreading. Indeed, in a connected planet, rapid world-wide spread isenabled by long-distance air-, land- and sea-transportation among countries andcontinents, and subsequently fostered by commuting trips within denselypopulated cities. While early travel restrictions contribute to delayed diseasespread, their utility is much reduced if the disease has a long incubationperiod or if there is asymptomatic transmission. Given the lack of vaccines,public health officials have mainly relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions,including social distancing measures, curfews, and stay-at-home orders. Here westudy the impact of city organization on its susceptibility to disease spread,and amenability to interventions. Cities can be classified according to theirmobility in a spectrum between compact-hierarchical and decentralized-sprawled.Our results show that even though hierarchical cities are more susceptible tothe rapid spread of epidemics, their organization makes mobility restrictionsquite effective. Conversely, sprawled cities are characterized by a much slowerinitial spread, but are less responsive to mobility restrictions. Thesefindings hold globally across cities in diverse geographical locations and abroad range of sizes. Our empirical measurements are confirmed by a simulationof COVID-19 spread in urban areas through a compartmental model. These resultssuggest that investing resources on early monitoring and prompt ad-hocinterventions in more vulnerable cities may prove most helpful in containingand reducing the impact of present and future pandemics.;/abs/2007.15367

Control Strategies for COVID-19 Epidemic with Vaccination, Shield  Immunity and Quarantine: A Metric Temporal Logic Approach";(Submitted on 29 Jul 2020 (;Zhe Xu;Bo Wu;Ufuk Topcu;;;"Ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, various public healthcontrol strategies have been proposed and tested against the coronavirusSARS-CoV-2. We study three specific COVID-19 epidemic control models: thesusceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccinationcontrol; the SEIR model with shield immunity control; and the susceptible,un-quarantined infected, quarantined infected, confirmed infected (SUQC) modelwith quarantine control. We express the control requirement in metric temporallogic (MTL) formulas (a type of formal specification languages) which canspecify the expected control outcomes such as ""the deaths from the infectionshould never exceed one thousand per day within the next three months"" or ""thepopulation immune from the disease should eventually exceed 200 thousand withinthe next 100 to 120 days"". We then develop methods for synthesizing controlstrategies with MTL specifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is thefirst paper to systematically synthesize control strategies based on theCOVID-19 epidemic models with formal specifications. We provide simulationresults in three different case studies: vaccination control for the COVID-19epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; shieldimmunity control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated fromdata in Lombardy, Italy; and quarantine control for the COVID-19 epidemic withmodel parameters estimated from data in Wuhan, China. The results show that theproposed synthesis approach can generate control inputs such that thetime-varying numbers of individuals in each category (e.g., infectious, immune)satisfy the MTL specifications. The results also show that early interventionis essential in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, and more control effort isneeded for more stringent MTL specifications.";/abs/2007.15114

A widely used tool to reduce the impact oftreatment-selection bias are so-called propensity score (PS) methods.Conditioning on the propensity score allows one to replicate the design of arandomized controlled trial, conditional on observed covariates. Extensionsinclude the g-computation approach, which is less frequently applied, inparticular in clinical studies. Moreover, doubly robust estimators provideadditional advantages.

Optimal periodic closure for minimizing risk in emerging disease  outbreaks";(Submitted on 31 Jul 2020 (;Jason Hindes;Simone Bianco;Ira B. Schwartz;;;Without vaccines and treatments, societies must rely on non-pharmaceuticalintervention strategies to control the spread of emerging diseases such asCOVID-19. Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because iteliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recentstudies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizingepidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate betweenwide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theoryhas been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a functionof epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such ananalytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristicclosure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increasepredictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease,as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach wedemonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximallyeffective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Ourresults compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 modelswhere infectivity and recovery show significant variability.;/abs/2007.16151

The impact of network properties and mixing on control measures and  disease-induced herd immunity in epidemic models: a mean-field model  perspective";(Submitted on 14 Jul 2020);Francesco Di Lauro;Luc Berthouze;Matthew D. Dorey;Joel C. Miller;István Z. Kiss;The contact structure of a population plays an important role in transmissionof infection. Many ``structured models'' capture aspects of the contactstructure through an underlying network or a mixing matrix. An importantobservation in such models, is that once a fraction $1-1/\mathcal{R}_0$ hasbeen infected, the residual susceptible population can no longer sustain anepidemic. A recent observation of some structured models is that this thresholdcan be crossed with a smaller fraction of infected individuals, because thedisease acts like a targeted vaccine, preferentially immunizing higher-riskindividuals who play a greater role in transmission. Therefore, a limited``first wave'' may leave behind a residual population that cannot support asecond wave once interventions are lifted. In this paper, we systematicallyanalyse a number of mean-field models for networks and other structuredpopulations to address issues relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular,we consider herd-immunity under several scenarios. We confirm that, in networkswith high degree heterogeneity, the first wave confers herd-immunity withsignificantly fewer infections than equivalent models with lower degreeheterogeneity. However, if modelling the intervention as a change in thecontact network, then this effect might become more subtle. Indeed, modifyingthe structure can shield highly connected nodes from becoming infected duringthe first wave and make the second wave more substantial. We confirm thisfinding by using an age-structured compartmental model parameterised with realdata and comparing lockdown periods implemented either as a global scaling ofthe mixing matrix or age-specific structural changes. We find that resultsregarding herd immunity levels are strongly dependent on the model, theduration of lockdown and how lockdown is implemented.;/abs/2007.06975

COVID-19: What If Immunity Wanes?";(Submitted on 7 Aug 2020);M. Alper Çenesiz;Luís Guimarães;;;;Using a simple economic model in which social-distancing reduces contagion,we study the implications of waning immunity for the epidemiological dynamicsand social activity. If immunity wanes, we find that COVID-19 likely becomesendemic and that social-distancing is here to stay until the discovery of avaccine or cure. But waning immunity does not necessarily change optimalactions on the onset of the pandemic. Decentralized equilibria are virtuallyindependent of waning immunity until close to peak infections. For centralizedequilibria, the relevance of waning immunity decreases in the probability offinding a vaccine or cure, the costs of infection (e.g., infection-fatalityrate), and the presence of other NPIs that lower contagion (e.g., quarantiningand mask use). In simulations calibrated to July 2020, our model suggests thatwaning immunity is virtually unimportant for centralized equilibria until atleast 2021. This provides vital time for individuals and policymakers to learnabout immunity against SARS-CoV-2 before it becomes critical.;/abs/2008.03283

A Critique of Immunity Passports and W3C Decentralized Identifiers";(Submitted on 30 Nov 2020);Harry Halpin;;;;;Due to the widespread COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a push for `immunitypassports' and even technical proposals. Although the debate about the medicaland ethical problems of immunity passports has been widespread, there has beenless inspection of the technical foundations of immunity passport schemes.These schemes are envisaged to be used for sharing COVID-19 test andvaccination results in general. The most prominent immunity passport schemeshave involved a stack of little-known standards, such as DecentralizedIdentifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide WebConsortium (W3C). Our analysis shows that this group of technical identitystandards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documentsthat have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to thequestionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunitypassports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of `cryptographytheater' in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used toallay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization.Deployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity' in use-caseslike immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identitytotalitarianism.;/abs/2012.00136

We are witnessing a helpless situation due toCOVID-19 as no vaccine or drug is effective against the disease. In the presentstudy, we have tested the applicability of some combination drugs againstCOVID-19. We have tried to understand the mechanism of action of somerepurposed drugs: Favipiravir (F), Hydroxychloroquine (H) and Oseltamivir (O).The ADME analysis have suggested strong inhibitory possibility of F, H, Ocombination towards receptor protein of $3CL^{pro}$ of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thestrong binding affinity, number of hydrogen bond interaction between inhibitor,receptor and lower inhibition constant computed from molecular dockingvalidated the better complexation possibility of F+H+O: $3CL^{pro}$combination. Various thermodynamical output from Molecular dynamics (MD)simulations like potential energy ($E_g$), temperature (T), density, pressure,SASA energy, interaction energies, Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G_{bind}$) etc.,also favored the complexation between F+H+O and CoV-2 protease. Our In-Silicoresults have recommended the strong candidature of combination drugsFavipiravir, Hydroxychloroquine and Oseltamivir as a potential lead inhibitorfor targeting SARS-CoV-2 infections.;/abs/2012.00652

A Stochastic Compartmental Model for COVID-19";(Submitted on 3 Dec 2020);Giorgio Sonnino;Fernando Mora;Pasquale Nardone;;;We propose two stochastic models for the Coronavirus pandemic. Thestatistical properties of the models, in particular the correlation functionsand the probability density function, have duly been computed. Our models,which generalises a model previously proposed and published in a specialisedjournal, take into account the adoption of the lockdown measures as well as thecrucial role of the hospitals and Health Care Institutes. To accomplish thiswork we have analysed two scenarios: the SIS-model (Susceptible => Infectious=> Susceptible) in presence of the lockdown measures and the SIS-modelintegrated with the action of the hospitals (always in presence of the lockdownmeasures). We show that in the case of the pure SIS-model, once the lockdownmeasures are removed, the Coronavirus will start growing again. However, in thesecond scenario, beyond a certain threshold of the hospital capacities, theCoronavirus is not only kept under control, but its capacity to spread tends todiminish in time. Therefore, the combined effect of the lockdown measures withthe action of the hospitals and health Institutes is able to contain and dampenthe spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. This result can be used during a periodof time when the massive distribution of delivery of a limited number ofvaccines in a given population is not yet feasible. By way of example, weanalysed the data for USA and France where the intensities of the noise havebeen estimated by Statistical Mechanics. In particular, for USA we haveanalysed two possible hypotheses: USA is still subject to the first wave ofinfection by and USA is in the second (or third) wave of SARS-CoV-2infection.The agreement between theoretical predictions and real data confirmsthe validity of our approach.;/abs/2012.01869

Digital Landscape of COVID-19 Testing: Challenges and Opportunities";(Submitted on 3 Dec 2020);Darshan Gandhi;Rohan Sukumaran;Priyanshi Katiyar;Alex Radunsky;Sunaina Anand;The COVID-19 Pandemic has left a devastating trail all over the world, interms of loss of lives, economic decline, travel restrictions, trade deficit,and collapsing economy including real-estate, job loss, loss of healthbenefits, the decline in quality of access to care and services and overallquality of life. Immunization from the anticipated vaccines will not be thestand-alone guideline that will help surpass the pandemic and return tonormalcy. Four pillars of effective public health intervention includediagnostic testing for both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, contacttracing, quarantine of individuals with symptoms or who are exposed toCOVID-19, and maintaining strict hygiene standards at the individual andcommunity level. Digital technology, currently being used for COVID-19 testinginclude certain mobile apps, web dashboards, and online self-assessment tools.Herein, we look into various digital solutions adapted by communities acrossuniversities, businesses, and other organizations. We summarize the challengesexperienced using these tools in terms of quality of information, privacy, anduser-centric issues. Despite numerous digital solutions available and beingdeveloped, many vary in terms of information being shared in terms of bothquality and quantity, which can be overwhelming to the users. Understanding thetesting landscape through a digital lens will give a clear insight into themultiple challenges that we face including data privacy, cost, andmiscommunication. It is the destiny of digitalization to navigate testing forCOVID-19. Block-chain based systems can be used for privacy preservation andensuring ownership of the data to remain with the user. Another solutioninvolves having digital health passports with relevant and correct information.In this early draft, we summarize the challenges and propose possible solutionsto address the same.;/abs/2012.01772

Fighting together against the pandemic: learning multiple models on  tomography images for COVID-19 diagnosis";(Submitted on 2 Dec 2020);Mario Manzo;Simone Pellino;;;;The great challenge for the humanity of the year 2020 is the fight againstCOVID-19. The whole world is making a huge effort to find an effective vaccinewith purpose to protect people not yet infected. The alternative solutionremains early diagnosis, carried out through real-time polymerase chainreaction (RT-PCR) test or thorax computer tomography (CT) scan images. Deeplearning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks, represent amethodology for the image analysis. They optimize the classification designtask, essential for an automatic approach on different types of images,including medical. In this paper, we adopt pretrained deep convolutional neuralnetwork architectures in order to diagnose COVID-19 disease on CT images. Ouridea is inspired by what the whole of humanity is achieving, substantially theset of multiple contributions is better than the single one for the fightagainst the pandemic. Firstly, we adapt, and subsequently retrain, for ourassumption some neural architectures adopted in other application domains.Secondly, we combine the knowledge extracted from images by neuralarchitectures in an ensemble classification context. Experimental phase isperformed on CT images dataset and results obtained show the effectiveness ofthe proposed approach with respect to state-of-the-art competitors.;/abs/2012.01251

Social Media Study of Public Opinions on Potential COVID-19 Vaccines:  Informing Dissent, Disparities, and Dissemination";(Submitted on 3 Dec 2020 (;Hanjia Lyu;Junda Wang;Wei Wu;Viet Duong;Xiyang Zhang;The current development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented. Littleis known, however, about the nuanced public opinions on the coming vaccines. Weadopt a human-guided machine learning framework (using more than 40,000rigorously selected tweets from more than 20,000 distinct Twitter users) tocapture public opinions on the potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, classifyingthem into three groups: pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant, and anti-vaccine. Weaggregate opinions at the state and country levels, and find that the majorchanges in the percentages of different opinion groups roughly correspond tothe major pandemic-related events. Interestingly, the percentage of thepro-vaccine group is lower in the Southeast part of the United States. Usingmultinomial logistic regression, we compare demographics, social capital,income, religious status, political affiliations, geo-locations, sentiment ofpersonal pandemic experience and non-pandemic experience, and county-levelpandemic severity perception of these three groups to investigate the scope andcauses of public opinions on vaccines. We find that socioeconomicallydisadvantaged groups are more likely to hold polarized opinions on potentialCOVID-19 vaccines. The anti-vaccine opinion is the strongest among the peoplewho have the worst personal pandemic experience. Next, by conductingcounterfactual analyses, we find that the U.S. public is most concerned aboutthe safety, effectiveness, and political issues regarding potential vaccinesfor COVID-19, and improving personal pandemic experience increases the vaccineacceptance level. We believe this is the first large-scale social media-basedstudy to analyze public opinions on potential COVID-19 vaccines that can informmore effective vaccine distribution policies and strategies.;/abs/2012.02165

Addressing machine learning concept drift reveals declining vaccine  sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic";(Submitted on 3 Dec 2020 (;Martin Müller;Marcel Salathé;;;;Social media analysis has become a common approach to assess public opinionon various topics, including those about health, in near real-time. The growingvolume of social media posts has led to an increased usage of modern machinelearning methods in natural language processing. While the rapid dynamics ofsocial media can capture underlying trends quickly, it also poses a technicalproblem: algorithms trained on annotated data in the past may underperform whenapplied to contemporary data. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, can beparticularly problematic when rapid shifts occur either in the topic ofinterest itself, or in the way the topic is discussed. Here, we explore theeffect of machine learning concept drift by focussing on vaccine sentimentsexpressed on Twitter, a topic of central importance especially during theCOVID-19 pandemic. We show that while vaccine sentiment has declinedconsiderably during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, algorithms trained onpre-pandemic data would have largely missed this decline due to concept drift.Our results suggest that social media analysis systems must address conceptdrift in a continuous fashion in order to avoid the risk of systematicmisclassification of data, which is particularly likely during a crisis whenthe underlying data can change suddenly and rapidly.;/abs/2012.02197

Artificial Intelligence for COVID-19 Detection -- A state-of-the-art  review";(Submitted on 25 Nov 2020);Parsa Sarosh;Shabir A. Parah;Romany F Mansur;G. M. Bhat;;The emergence of COVID-19 has necessitated many efforts by the scientificcommunity for its proper management. An urgent clinical reaction is required inthe face of the unending devastation being caused by the pandemic. Theseefforts include technological innovations for improvement in screening,treatment, vaccine development, contact tracing and, survival prediction. Theuse of Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be sought in allof the above-mentioned spheres. This paper aims to review the role of DeepLearning and Artificial intelligence in various aspects of the overall COVID-19management and particularly for COVID-19 detection and classification. The DLmodels are developed to analyze clinical modalities like CT scans and X-Rayimages of patients and predict their pathological condition. A DL model aims todetect the COVID-19 pneumonia, classify and distinguish between COVID-19,Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), Viral and Bacterial pneumonia, and normalconditions. Furthermore, sophisticated models can be built to segment theaffected area in the lungs and quantify the infection volume for a betterunderstanding of the extent of damage. Many models have been developed eitherindependently or with the help of pre-trained models like VGG19, ResNet50, andAlexNet leveraging the concept of transfer learning. Apart from modeldevelopment, data preprocessing and augmentation are also performed to copewith the challenge of insufficient data samples often encountered in medicalapplications. It can be evaluated that DL and AI can be effectively implementedto withstand the challenges posed by the global emergency;/abs/2012.06310

Severalpharmaceutical companies made significant progress in developing effectivevaccines against the Covid-19 virus that has claimed the lives of more than amillion people over the world. On the other hand, there is growing evidence ofre-infection by the virus, which can cause further outbreaks. In this paper, weapply statistical physics tools to examine the vaccination rate required tocontrol the pandemic for three different vaccine efficiency scenarios. Also, westudy the effect of temporal restrictions/reliefs on the pandemic's outbreak,assuming that re-infection is possible. When examining the efficiency of thevaccination rate of the general population in preventing an additional outbreakof the disease, we find that a high vaccination rate (where at least 0.3% ofthe population is vaccinated daily, which is equivalent to ~ 1 million vaccinedoses in the United States daily) is required to gain control over the spreadof the virus without further restrictions. Due to feasible limitations on thevaccination rate, the vaccination process should be accompanied by theprevailing restrictions until most of the population is vaccinated.;/abs/2012.07306

Simple mathematical models for controlling COVID-19 transmission through  social distancing and community awareness";(Submitted on 24 Dec 2020);Ahmed S.

In thisstudy, simple mathematical models were employed to examine the dynamics oftransmission and control of COVID-19 taking into consideration socialdistancing and community awareness. Both situations of homogeneous andnonhomogeneous population were considered. Based on the calculations, asufficient degree of social distancing based on its reproductive ratio is foundto be effective in controlling COVID-19, even in the absence of a vaccine. Witha vaccine, social distancing minimizes the sufficient vaccination rate tocontrol the disease. Community awareness also has a great impact in eradicatingthe virus transmission.

Standard compartment models failwhen they are implemented in the Argentina case. We extended a previoussuccessful model to describe the geographical spread of the AH1N1 influenzaepidemic of 2009 in two essential ways: we added a stochastic local mobilitymechanism, and we introduced a new compartment in order to take into accountthe isolation of infected asymptomatic detected people. Two fundamentalparameters drive the dynamics: the time elapsed between contagious andisolation of infected individuals ($\alpha$) and the ratio of people isolatedover the total infected ones ($p$). The evolution is more sensitive to the$p-$parameter. The model not only reproduces the real data but also predictsthe second wave before the former vanishes. This effect is intrinsic ofextensive countries with heterogeneous population density and interconnection.The model presented here becomes a good predictor of the effects of publicpolicies as, for instance, the unavoidable vaccination campaigns starting atpresent in the world.;/abs/2012.15209

Optimising SARS-CoV-2 pooled testing strategies on social networks for  low-resource settings";(Submitted on 31 Dec 2020);Karina I Mazzitello;Yi Jiang;Constancio M Arizmendi;;;Controlling the COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent global challenge. The rapidgeographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 directly reflects the social structure. Beforeeffective vaccines and treatments are widely available, we have to rely onalternative, non-pharmaceutical interventions, including frequency testing,contact tracing, social distancing, mask wearing, and hand-washing, as publichealth practises to slow down the spread of the disease. However frequenttesting is the key in the absence of any alternative. We propose a networkapproach to determine the optimal low resources setting oriented pool testingstrategies that identifies infected individuals in a small number of tests andfew rounds of testing, at low prevalence of the virus. We simulate stochasticinfection curves on societies under quarantine. Allowing some socialinteraction is possible to keep the COVID-19 curve flat. However, similarresults can be strategically obtained searching and isolating infected personsto preserve a healthier social structure. Here, we analyze which are the beststrategies to contain the virus applying an algorithm that combine samples andtesting them in groups [1]. A relevant parameter to keep infection curves flatusing this algorithm is the dairy frequency of testing at zones where a highinfection rate is reported. On the other hand, the algorithm efficiency is lowfor random search of infected people.;/abs/2012.15702

Networks of Necessity: Simulating Strategies for COVID-19 Mitigation  among Disabled People and Their Caregivers";(Submitted on 31 Dec 2020);Thomas E. Valles;Hannah Shoenhard;Joseph Zinski;Sarah Trick;Mason A. Porter;A major strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is through the limiting ofin-person contacts. However, for the many disabled people who live in thecommunity and require caregivers to assist them with activities of dailyliving, limiting contacts is impractical or impossible. We seek to determinewhich interventions can prevent infections among disabled people and theircaregivers. To accomplish this, we simulate COVID-19 transmission with acompartmental model on a network. The networks incorporate heterogeneity in therisks of different types of interactions, time-dependent lockdown and reopeningmeasures, and interaction distributions for four different groups (caregivers,disabled people, essential workers, and the general population). Among thesegroups, we find the probability of becoming infected is highest for caregiversand second highest for disabled people. Our analysis of the network structureillustrates that caregivers have the largest modal eigenvector centrality amongthe four groups. We find that two interventions -- contact-limiting by allgroups and mask-wearing by disabled people and caregivers -- particularlyreduce cases among disabled people and caregivers. We also test which groupmost effectively spreads COVID-19 by seeding infections in a subset of eachgroup and then comparing the total number of infections as the disease spreads.We find that caregivers are the most effective spreaders of COVID-19. We thentest where limited vaccine doses could be used most effectively and we findthat vaccinating caregivers better protects disabled people than vaccinatingthe general population, essential workers, or the disabled population itself.Our results highlight the potential effectiveness of mask-wearing,contact-limiting throughout society, and strategic vaccination for limiting theexposure of disabled people and their caregivers to COVID-19.;/abs/2101.00060

Novel Coronavirus officially calledCOVID-19, which has become a pandemic and has created a crisis in humanhistory, is one such topic that has attracted a lot of attention on Twitter inrecent times. In this work, we analyze 29 million tweets spanning across threemonths, to study highly influential users, which we called as leaders. Weidentify these leaders using social network analysis and analyze their tweetsusing text analysis techniques. We group these leaders in four clusters, namelyresearch, news, health and politics. Our analysis shows that i) all clustersshow a similar amount of fear in their tweets, ii) researchers and news clusterdisplay more sadness compared to others and, iii) health organizations andpoliticians try to gain public trust. The text analysis shows that theresearchers are more concerned about understanding symptoms and developingvaccination; news and politicians are mainly discussing about travel andhygiene; and health organizations focuses on hygiene. Our descriptive analysishelps us to extract various features that we used to classify tweets among thefour clusters with an accuracy of 96% AUC ROC.";/abs/2101.03002

Covid-19 infodemic reveals new tipping point epidemiology and a revised  $R$ formula";(Submitted on 19 Aug 2020);N.F. Johnson;N. Velasquez;O.K. Jha;H. Niyazi;R. Leahy;Many governments have managed to control their COVID-19 outbreak with asimple message: keep the effective '$R$ number' $R<1$ to prevent widespreadcontagion and flatten the curve. This raises the question whether a similarpolicy could control dangerous online 'infodemics' of information,misinformation and disinformation. Here we show, using multi-platform data fromthe COVID-19 infodemic, that its online spreading instead encompasses adifferent dynamical regime where communities and users within and acrossindependent platforms, sporadically form temporary active links on similartimescales to the viral spreading. This allows material that might have diedout, to evolve and even mutate. This has enabled niche networks that werealready successfully spreading hate and anti-vaccination material, to rapidlybecome global super-spreaders of narratives featuring fake COVID-19 treatments,anti-Asian sentiment and conspiracy theories. We derive new tools thatincorporate these coupled social-viral dynamics, including an online $R$, tohelp prevent infodemic spreading at all scales: from spreading across platforms(e.g. Facebook, 4Chan) to spreading within a given subpopulation, or community,or topic. By accounting for similar social and viral timescales, the samemathematical theory also offers a quantitative description of otherunconventional infection profiles such as rumors spreading in financial marketsand colds spreading in schools.;/abs/2008.08513

The commondiagnostics testing methods has been only partially effective in satisfying thebooming demand for fast detection methods to contain the further spread.However, the point-of-risk accurate diagnosis of this new emerging viralinfection is paramount as simultaneous normal working operation and dealingwith symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 can become the norm for years to come. Sensitivecost-effective biosensor with mass production capability is crucial throughoutthe world until a universal vaccination become available. Optical label-freebiosensors can provide a non-invasive, extremely sensitive rapid detectiontechnique up to ~1 fM concentration along with few minutes sensing. Thesebiosensors can be manufactured on a mass-scale (billions) to detect theCOVID-19 viral load in nasal, saliva, urinal, and serological samples even ifthe infected person is asymptotic. Methods investigated here are the mostadvanced available platforms for biosensing optical devices resulted from theintegration of state-of-the-art designs and materials. These approaches areincluding but not limited to integrated optical devices, plasmonic resonanceand also emerging nanomaterial biosensors. The lab-on-a-chip platforms examinedhere are suitable not only for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection but alsoother contagious virions such as influenza, and middle east respiratorysyndrome (MERS).;/abs/2008.08572

Quarantines as a Targeted Immunization Strategy";(Submitted on 19 Aug 2020 (;Jessica Hoffmann;Matt Jordan;Constantine Caramanis;;;"In the context of the recent COVID-19 outbreak, quarantine has been used to""flatten the curve"" and slow the spread of the disease. In this paper, we showthat this is not the only benefit of quarantine for the mitigation of an SIRepidemic spreading on a graph. Indeed, human contact networks exhibit apowerlaw structure, which means immunizing nodes at random is extremelyineffective at slowing the epidemic, while immunizing high-degree nodes canefficiently guarantee herd immunity. We theoretically prove that if quarantinesare declared at the right moment, high-degree nodes are disproportionately inthe Removed state, which is a form of targeted immunization. Even ifquarantines are declared too early, subsequent waves of infection spread slowerthan the first waves. This leads us to propose an opening and closing strategyaiming at immunizing the graph while infecting the minimum number ofindividuals, guaranteeing the population is now robust to future infections. Tothe best of our knowledge, this is the only strategy that guarantees herdimmunity without requiring vaccines. We extensively verify our results onsimulated and real-life networks.";/abs/2008.08262

The unintended consequences of inconsistent pandemic control policies";(Submitted on 21 Aug 2020 (;Benjamin M. Althouse;Brendan Wallace;Brendan Case;Samuel V. Scarpino;Andrew M. Berdahl;"Controlling the spread of COVID-19 - even after a licensed vaccine isavailable - requires the effective use of non-pharmaceutical interventions:physical distancing, limits on group sizes, mask wearing, etc. To date, suchinterventions have neither been uniformly nor systematically implemented inmost countries. For example, even when under strict stay-at-home orders,numerous jurisdictions granted exceptions and/or were in close proximity tolocations with entirely different regulations in place. Here, we investigatethe impact of such geographic inconsistencies in epidemic control policies bycoupling search and mobility data to a simple mathematical model of SARS-COV2transmission. Our results show that while stay-at-home orders decrease contactsin most areas of the US, some specific activities and venues often see anincrease in attendance. Indeed, over the month of March 2020, between 10 and30% of churches in the US saw increases in attendance; even as the total numberof visits to churches declined nationally. This heterogeneity, where certainvenues see substantial increases in attendance while others close, suggeststhat closure can cause individuals to find an open venue, even if that requireslonger-distance travel. And, indeed, the average distance travelled to churchesin the US rose by 13% over the same period. Strikingly, our model reveals thatacross a broad range of model parameters, partial measures can often be worsethan none at all where individuals not complying with policies by traveling toneighboring areas can create epidemics when the outbreak would otherwise havebeen controlled. Taken together, our data analysis and modelling resultshighlight the potential unintended consequences of inconsistent epidemiccontrol policies and stress the importance of balancing the societal needs of apopulation with the risk of an outbreak growing into a large epidemic.";/abs/2008.09629

Analysis of COVID-19 cases in India through Machine Learning: A Study of  Intervention";(Submitted on 17 Aug 2020);Hanuman Verma;Akshansh Gupta;Utkarsh Niranjan;;;To combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the world hasvaccination, plasma therapy, herd immunity, and epidemiological interventionsas few possible options. The COVID-19 vaccine development is underway and itmay take a significant amount of time to develop the vaccine and afterdevelopment, it will take time to vaccinate the entire population, and plasmatherapy has some limitations. Herd immunity can be a plausible option to fightCOVID-19 for small countries. But for a country with huge population likeIndia, herd immunity is not a plausible option, because to acquire herdimmunity approximately 67% of the population has to be recovered from COVID-19infection, which will put an extra burden on medical system of the country andwill result in a huge loss of human life. Thus epidemiological interventions(complete lockdown, partial lockdown, quarantine, isolation, social distancing,etc.) are some suitable strategies in India to slow down the COVID-19 spreaduntil the vaccine development. In this work, we have suggested the SIR modelwith intervention, which incorporates the epidemiological interventions in theclassical SIR model. To model the effect of the interventions, we haveintroduced \r{ho} as the intervention parameter. \r{ho} is a cumulativequantity which covers all type of intervention. We have also discussed thesupervised machine learning approach to estimate the transmission rate(\b{eta}) for the SIR model with intervention from the prevalence of COVID-19data in India and some states of India. To validate our model, we present acomparison between the actual and model-predicted number of COVID-19 cases.Using our model, we also present predicted numbers of active and recoveredCOVID-19 cases till Sept 30, 2020, for entire India and some states of Indiaand also estimate the 95% and 99% confidence interval for the predicted cases.;/abs/2008.10450

Data monitoring committees for clinical trials evaluating treatments of  COVID-19";(Submitted on 20 Aug 2020);Tobias Mütze;Tim Friede;;;;The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported inDecember 2019 and the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic in March2020 by the World Health Organization. This sparked a plethora ofinvestigations into diagnostics and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2, as well astreatments for COVID-19. Since COVID-19 is a severe disease associated with ahigh mortality, clinical trials in this disease should be monitored by a datamonitoring committee (DMC), also known as data safety monitoring board (DSMB).DMCs in this indication face a number of challenges including fast recruitmentrequiring an unusually high frequency of safety reviews, more frequent use ofcomplex designs and virtually no prior experience with the disease. In thispaper, we provide a perspective on the work of DMCs for clinical trials oftreatments for COVID-19. More specifically, we discuss organizational aspectsof setting up and running DMCs for COVID-19 trials, in particular for trialswith more complex designs such as platform trials or adaptive designs.Furthermore, statistical aspects of monitoring clinical trials of treatmentsfor COVID-19 are considered. Some recommendations are made regarding thepresentation of the data, stopping rules for safety monitoring and the use ofexternal data. The proposed stopping boundaries are assessed in a simulationstudy motivated by clinical trials in COVID-19.;/abs/2008.10992

A hydrophobic-interaction-based mechanism trigger docking between the  SARS CoV 2 spike and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2";(Submitted on 27 Aug 2020);Jiacheng Li;Xiaoliang Ma;Shuai Guo;Chengyu Hou;Liping Shi;"A recent experimental study found that the binding affinity between thecellular receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) andreceptor-binding domain (RBD) in spike (S) protein of novel severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is more than 10-fold higherthan that of the original severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus(SARS-CoV). However, main-chain structures of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD are almost thesame with that of the SARS-CoV RBD. Understanding physical mechanismresponsible for the outstanding affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 isthe ""urgent challenge"" for developing blockers, vaccines and therapeuticantibodies against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.Considering the mechanisms of hydrophobic interaction, hydration shell, surfacetension, and the shielding effect of water molecules, this study reveals ahydrophobic-interaction-based mechanism by means of which SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2bind together in an aqueous environment. The hydrophobic interaction betweenthe SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 protein is found to be significantly greater thanthat between SARS-CoV S and ACE2. At the docking site, the hydrophobic portionsof the hydrophilic side chains of SARS-CoV-2 S are found to be involved in thehydrophobic interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2. We propose a method todesign live attenuated viruses by mutating several key amino acid residues ofthe spike protein to decrease the hydrophobic surface areas at the dockingsite. Mutation of a small amount of residues can greatly reduce the hydrophobicbinding of the coronavirus to the receptor, which may be significant reduceinfectivity and transmissibility of the virus.";/abs/2008.11883

Do Black and Indigenous Communities Receive their Fair Share of Vaccines  Under the 2018 CDC Guidelines";(Submitted on 7 Sep 2020);Parag A. Pathak;Harald Schmidt;Adam Solomon;Edwin Song;Tayfun Sönmez;A major focus of debate about rationing guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines iswhether and how to prioritize access for minority populations that have beenparticularly affected by the pandemic, and been the subject of historical andstructural disadvantage, particularly Black and Indigenous individuals. Wesimulate the 2018 CDC Vaccine Allocation guidelines using data from theAmerican Community Survey under different assumptions on total vaccine supply.Black and Indigenous individuals combined receive a higher share of vaccinescompared to their population share for all assumptions on total vaccine supply.However, their vaccine share under the 2018 CDC guidelines is considerablylower than their share of COVID-19 deaths and age-adjusted deaths. We thensimulate one method to incorporate disadvantage in vaccine allocation via areserve system. In a reserve system, units are placed into categories and unitsreserved for a category give preferential treatment to individuals from thatcategory. Using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) as a proxy for disadvantage,we show that a 40% high-ADI reserve increases the number of vaccines allocatedto Black or Indigenous individuals, with a share that approaches their COVID-19death share when there are about 75 million units. Our findings illustrate thatwhether an allocation is equitable depends crucially on the benchmark andhighlight the importance of considering the expected distribution of outcomesfrom implementing vaccine allocation guidelines.;/abs/2009.02853

Assess the impacts of human mobility change on COVID-19 dynamics in  Arizona, U.S.: a modeling study incorporating Google Community Mobility  Reports";(Submitted on 4 Sep 2020);Nao Yamamoto;Haiyan Wang;;;;In June 2020, Arizona, U.S., emerged as one of the world's worst coronavirusdisease 2019(COVID-19) spots after the stay-at-home order was lifted in themiddle of May. However, with the decisions to reimpose restrictions, the numberof COVID-19 cases has been declining, and Arizona is considered to be a goodmodel in slowing the epidemic.

Weconstructed the mobility integrated metapopulationsusceptible-infectious-removed model and fitted to publicly available datasetson COVID-19 cases and mobility changes in Arizona. Our simulations showed thatby reducing human mobility, the peak time was delayed, and the final size ofthe epidemic was decreased in all three regions. Our analysis suggests thatrapid and effective decision making is crucial to control human mobility and,therefore, COVID-19 epidemics. Until a vaccine is available, reimplementationsof mobility restrictions in response to the increase of new COVID-19 casesmight need to be considered in Arizona and beyond.;/abs/2009.02419

Computational evidence on repurposing the anti-influenza drugs baloxavir  acid and baloxavir marboxil against COVID-19";(Submitted on 2 Sep 2020);Suban K Sahoo;Seshu Vardhan;;;;The main reasons for the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemicare the unavailability of recommended efficacious drugs or vaccines along withthe human to human transmission nature of SARS-CoV-2 virus. So, there is urgentneed to search appropriate therapeutic approach by repurposing approved drugs.In this communication, molecular docking analyses of two influenza antiviraldrugs baloxavir acid (BXA) and baloxavir marboxil (BXM) were performed with thethree therapeutic target proteins of severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), i.e., main protease (Mpro), papain-like protease(PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The molecular docking resultsof both the drugs BXA and BXM were analysed and compared. The investigationaldrug BXA binds at the active site of Mpro and RdRp, whereas the approved drugBXM binds only at the active site of RdRp. Also, comparison of dock scorerevealed that BXA is binding more effectively at the active site of RdRp thanBXM. The computational molecular docking revealed that the drug BXA may be moreeffective against COVID-19 as compared to BXM.;/abs/2009.01094

Data-driven Optimized Control of the COVID-19 Epidemics";(Submitted on 4 Sep 2020 (;Afroza Shirin;Yen Ting Lin;Francesco Sorrentino;;;Optimizing the impact on the economy of control strategies aiming atcontaining the spread of COVID-19 is a critical challenge. We use daily newcase counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health administrations fromdifferent Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize amodel that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We thenintroduce a time-varying control input that represents the level of socialdistancing imposed on the population of a given area and solve an optimalcontrol problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing onthe economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level ofsuppression for the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with theexception of the initial time and of the final time, the optimal control inputis well approximated by a constant, specific to each area, which contrasts withthe implemented system of reopening `in phases'. For all the areas considered,this optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the levelestimated from data. Proper selection of the time period for application of thecontrol action optimally is important: depending on the particular MSA thisperiod should be either short or long or intermediate. We also consider thecase that the transmissibility increases in time (due e.g. to increasinglycolder weather), for which we find that the optimal control solution yieldsprogressively stricter measures of social distancing. {We finally compute theoptimal control solution for a model modified to incorporate the effects ofvaccinations on the population and we see that depending on a number offactors, social distancing measures could be optimally reduced during theperiod over which vaccines are administered to the population.;/abs/2009.03753

For any TTI strategy, however, mitigation is challenged by pre- andasymptomatic transmission, TTI-avoiders, and undetected spreaders, who stronglycontribute to hidden infection chains. Here, we studied a semi-analytical modeland identified two tipping points between controlled and uncontrolled spread:(1) the behavior-driven reproduction number of the hidden chains becomes toolarge to be compensated by the TTI capabilities, and (2) the number of newinfections exceeds the tracing capacity. Both trigger a self-acceleratingspread. We investigated how these tipping points depend on challenges likelimited cooperation, missing contacts, and imperfect isolation. Our modelresults suggest that TTI alone is insufficient to contain an otherwiseunhindered spread of SARS-CoV-2, implying that complementary measures likesocial distancing and improved hygiene remain necessary.;/abs/2009.05732

Dynamic causal modelling of immune heterogeneity";(Submitted on 17 Sep 2020);Thomas Parr;Anjali Bhat;Peter Zeidman;Aimee Goel;Alexander J. Billig;An interesting inference drawn by some Covid-19 epidemiological models isthat there exists a proportion of the population who are not susceptible toinfection -- even at the start of the current pandemic. This paper introduces amodel of the immune response to a virus. This is based upon the same sort ofmean-field dynamics as used in epidemiology. However, in place of the location,clinical status, and other attributes of people in an epidemiological model, weconsider the state of a virus, B and T-lymphocytes, and the antibodies theygenerate. Our aim is to formalise some key hypotheses as to the mechanism ofresistance. We present a series of simple simulations illustrating changes tothe dynamics of the immune response under these hypotheses. These includeattenuated viral cell entry, pre-existing cross-reactive humoral(antibody-mediated) immunity, and enhanced T-cell dependent immunity. Finally,we illustrate the potential application of this sort of model by illustratingvariational inversion (using simulated data) of this model to illustrate itsuse in testing hypotheses. In principle, this furnishes a fast and efficientimmunological assay--based on sequential serology--that provides a (i)quantitative measure of latent immunological responses and (ii) a Bayes optimalclassification of the different kinds of immunological response (c.f., glucosetolerance tests used to test for insulin resistance).

Clustering COVID-19 Lung Scans";(Submitted on 5 Sep 2020);Jacob Householder;Andrew Householder;John Paul Gomez-Reed;Fredrick Park;Shuai Zhang;"With the recent outbreak of COVID-19, creating a means to stop it's spreadand eventually develop a vaccine are the most important and challenging tasksthat the scientific community is facing right now. The first step towards thesegoals is to correctly identify a patient that is infected with the virus. Ourgroup applied an unsupervised machine learning technique to identify COVID-19cases. This is an important topic as COVID-19 is a novel disease currentlybeing studied in detail and our methodology has the potential to revealimportant differences between it and other viral pneumonia. This could then, inturn, enable doctors to more confidently help each patient. Our experimentsutilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic NeighborEmbedding (t-SNE), and the recently developed Robust Continuous Clusteringalgorithm (RCC). We display the performance of RCC in identifying COVID-19patients and its ability to compete with other unsupervised algorithms, namelyK-Means++ (KM++). Using a COVID-19 Radiography dataset, we found that RCCoutperformed KM++; we used the Adjusted Mutual Information Score (AMI) in orderto measure the effectiveness of both algorithms. The AMI for the two and threeclass cases of KM++ were 0.0250 and 0.054, respectively. In comparison, RCCscored 0.5044 in the two class case and 0.267 in the three class case, clearlyshowing RCC as the superior algorithm. This not only opens new possibleapplications of RCC, but it could potentially aid in the creation of a new toolfor COVID-19 identification.";/abs/2009.09899

Convalescent Blood Treatment for COVID-19: Are Local Donors Enough?";(Submitted on 27 Sep 2020);Pamela K. Douglas;Farzad V. Farahani;David B. Douglas;Susan Bookheimer;;COVID-19 is now a global pandemic, and an effective vaccine may be manymonths away. Over 100 years ago, Spanish flu fatalities were attenuated whendoctors began treating patients with blood plasma donated by recovered (orconvalesced) survivors. Passive immunity transfer via administration ofconvalesced blood product (CBP) appears to represent a readily available andpromising avenue for mitigating mortalities, expediting recovery time, and evenprophylaxis against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, we review challenges to CBPefficacy, and present a graph theoretical model of transmission dynamics thatidentifies evolving hubs of COVID-19 cases. Importantly, this model suggeststhat CBP efficacy may rest on an efficient and distributed global samplingscheme as opposed to CBP pooled from local donors alone.;/abs/2009.12773

Planning of School Teaching during COVID-19";(Submitted on 5 Jun 2020);Alberto Gandolfi;;;;;"More than one billion students are out of school because of Covid-19, forcedto a remote learning that has several drawbacks and has been hurriedlyarranged; in addition, most countries are currently uncertain on how to planschool activities for the 2020-2021 school year; all of this makes learning andeducation some of the biggest world issues of the current pandemic.Unfortunately, due to the length of the incubation period of Covid-19, fullopening of schools seems to be impractical till a vaccine is available. Inorder to support the possibility of some in-person learning, we study amathematical model of the diffusion of the epidemic due to school opening, andevaluate plans aimed at containing the extra Covid-19 cases due to schoolactivities while ensuring an adequate number of in-class learning periods. Weconsider a SEAIR model with an external source of infection and a suitable lossfunction; after a realistic parameter selection, we numerically determineoptimal school opening strategies by simulated annealing. It turns out thatblended models, with almost periodic alternations of in-class and remoteteaching days or weeks, are generally optimal. Besides containing Covid-19diffusion, these solutions could be pedagogically acceptable, and could alsobecome a driving model for the society at large. In a prototypical example, theoptimal strategy results in the school opening 90 days out of 200 with thenumber of Covid-19 cases among the individuals related to the school increasingby about 66%, instead of the about 250% increase that would have been aconsequence of full opening.";/abs/2006.03672

Medidas de distanciamento social e mobilidade na América do Sul  durante a pandemia por COVID-19: Condições necessárias e suficientes?";(Submitted on 8 Jun 2020);Gisliany Lillian Alves de Oliveira;Luciana Conceição de Lima;Ivanovitch Silva;Marcel da Câmara Ribeiro-Dantas;Kayo Henrique Monteiro;In a scenario where there is no vaccine for COVID-19, non-pharmaceuticalinterventions are necessary to contain the spread of the virus and the collapseof the health system in the affected regions. One of these measures is socialdistancing, which aims to reduce interactions in the community by closingpublic and private establishments that involve crowds of people. The lockdownpresupposes a drastic reduction in community interactions, representing a moreextreme measure of social distancing. Based on geolocation data provided byGoogle for six categories of physical spaces, this article identifies thevariations in the circulation of people in South America for different types ofsocial distancing measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study,population mobility trends for a group of countries between February 15, 2020and May 16, 2020 were analyzed. To summarize these trends in a single metric, ageneral circulation index was created, and to identify regional mobilitypatterns, descriptive analyzes of spatial autocorrelation (global and localMoran index) were used. The first hypothesis of this study is that countrieswith a lockdown decree can achieve greater success in reducing the mobility ofthe population, and the second hypothesis is that Argentina, Brazil andColombia have regional mobility patterns. The first hypothesis was partiallyconfirmed (considering 10 countries in South America), and the results obtainedin the spatial analyzes confirmed the second hypothesis. In general, theobserved data shows that less rigid lockdown or social distancing measures arenecessary, however, they are not sufficient to achieve a significant reductionin the circulation of people during the pandemic.;/abs/2006.04985

Modelling the second wave of COVID-19 infections in France and Italy via  a Stochastic SEIR model";(Submitted on 9 Jun 2020);Davide Faranda;Tommaso Alberti;;;;COVID-19 has forced quarantine measures in several countries across theworld. These measures have proven to be effective in significantly reducing theprevalence of the virus. To date, no effective treatment or vaccine isavailable. In the effort of preserving both public health as well as theeconomical and social textures, France and Italy governments have partiallyreleased lockdown measures. Here we extrapolate the long-term behavior of theepidemics in both countries using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered(SEIR) model where parameters are stochastically perturbed to handle theuncertainty in the estimates of COVID-19 prevalence. Our results suggest thatuncertainties in both parameters and initial conditions rapidly propagate inthe model and can result in different outcomes of the epidemics leading or notto a second wave of infections. Using actual knowledge, asymptotic estimates ofCOVID-19 prevalence can fluctuate of order of ten millions units in bothcountries.;/abs/2006.05081

BCG vaccination in infancy does not protect against COVID-19. Evidence  from a natural experiment in Sweden";(Submitted on 8 Jun 2020 (;Clément de Chaisemartin;Luc de Chaisemartin;;;;The Bacille Calmette-Gu\'erin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine has immunitybenefits against respiratory infections. Accordingly, it has been hypothesizedthat it may have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research foundthat countries with universal Bacillus Calmette-Gu\'erin (BCG) childhoodvaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead,this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that tookplace in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination ledto a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2% , thus allowing usto estimate the BCG's effect without all the biases associated withcross-country comparisons. Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations wererecorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change,representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We usedregression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a highprecision that would be hard to achieve using a classical randomized controlledtrial. The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizationswere 0.9997 (CI95: [0.8002-1.1992]) and 1.1931 (CI95: [0.7558-1.6304]),respectively. We can thus reject with 95\% confidence that universal BCGvaccination reduces the number of cases by more than 20% and the number ofhospitalizations by more than 24%. While the effect of a recent vaccinationmust be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine atbirth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19.;/abs/2006.05504

Optimal immunity control by social distancing for the SIR epidemic model";(Submitted on 10 Jun 2020);Pierre-Alexandre Bliman;Michel Duprez;Yannick Privat;Nicolas Vauchelet;;Until a vaccine or therapy is found against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus,reaching herd immunity appears to be the only mid-term option. However, if thenumber of infected individuals decreases and eventually fades only beyond thisthreshold, a significant proportion of susceptible may still be infected untilthe epidemic is over. A containment strategy is likely the best policy in theworst case where no vaccine or therapy is found. In order to keep the number ofnewly infected persons to a minimum, a possible strategy is to apply strictcontainment measures, so that the number of susceptible individuals remainsclose to herd immunity. Such an action is unrealistic since containment canonly last for a finite amount of time and is never total. In this article,using a classical SIR model, we determine the (partial or total) containmentstrategy on a given finite time interval that maximizes the number ofsusceptible individuals over an infinite horizon, or equivalently thatminimizes the total infection burden during the curse of the epidemic. Theexistence and uniqueness of the optimal strategy is proved and the latter isfully characterized. If applicable in practice, such a strategy would leadtheoretically to an increase by 30% of the proportion of susceptible on aninfinite horizon, for a containment level corresponding to the sanitarymeasures put in place in France from March to May 2020. We also analyze theminimum intervention time to reach a fixed distance from herd immunity, andshow the relationship with the previous problem.

Compared withtraditional small-molecular drugs, antibody therapies are relatively easy todevelop and as specific as vaccines in targeting severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and thus attract much attention in thepast few months. This work reviews seven existing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2spike (S) protein with three-dimensional (3D) structures deposited in theProtein Data Bank. Five antibody structures associated with SARS-CoV areevaluated for their potential in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. The interactions ofthese antibodies with the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) are comparedwith those of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and RBD complexes. Due tothe orders of magnitude in the discrepancies of experimental bindingaffinities, we introduce topological data analysis (TDA), a variety of networkmodels, and deep learning to analyze the binding strength and therapeuticpotential of the aforementioned fourteen antibody-antigen complexes.

Forecasting the daily and cumulative number of cases for the COVID-19  pandemic in India";(Submitted on 25 Jun 2020);Subhas Khajanchi;Kankan Sarkar;;;;The ongoing novel coronavirus epidemic has been announced a pandemic by theWorld Health Organization on March 11, 2020, and the Govt. of India hasdeclared a nationwide lockdown from March 25, 2020, to prevent communitytransmission of COVID-19. Due to absence of specific antivirals or vaccine,mathematical modeling play an important role to better understand the diseasedynamics and designing strategies to control rapidly spreading infectiousdiseases. In our study, we developed a new compartmental model that explainsthe transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We calibrated our proposed model withdaily COVID-19 data for the four Indian provinces, namely Jharkhand, Gujarat,Andhra Pradesh, and Chandigarh. We study the qualitative properties of themodel including feasible equilibria and their stability with respect to thebasic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$. The disease-free equilibrium becomesstable and the endemic equilibrium becomes unstable when the recovery rate ofinfected individuals increased but if the disease transmission rate remainshigher then the endemic equilibrium always remain stable. For the estimatedmodel parameters, $\mathcal{R}_0 >1$ for all the four provinces, which suggeststhe significant outbreak of COVID-19.

Drug Repurposing to find Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease";(Submitted on 26 Jun 2020);Emilio Angelina;Sebastian Andujar;Oscar Parravicini;Daniel Enriz;Nelida Peruchena;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain ofcoronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratoryillness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently there is no knownvaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and so, there is an urgentneed for expedite discovery of new therapeutics to combat the disease until avaccine will be available worldwide. Drug repurposing is a strategy foridentifying new uses for approved drugs that has the advantage (overconventional approaches that attempt to develop a drug from scratch) that timeframe of the overall process can be significantly reduced because of the fewnumber of clinical trial required. In this work, a virtual screening ofFDA-approved drugs was performed for repositioning as potential inhibitors ofthe main protease Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. As a result of this study, 12 drugs areproposed as candidates for inhibitors of the Mpro enzyme. Some of the selectedcompounds are antiviral drugs that are already being tested in COVID-19clinical trials (i.e. ribavirin) or are used to alleviate symptoms of thedisease (i.e. codeine). Surprisingly, the most promising candidate is thenaturally occurring broad spectrum antibiotic oxytetracycline. This compoundhas largely outperformed the remaining selected candidates along all filteringsteps of our virtual screening protocol. If the activity of any of these drugsis experimentally corroborated, they could be used directly in clinical trialswithout the need for pre-clinical testing or safety evaluation since they arealready used as drugs for other diseases.;/abs/2006.14790

Modelling Excess Mortality in Covid-19-like Epidemics";(Submitted on 28 Jun 2020 (;Zdzislaw Burda;;;;;We develop an agent-based model to assess the cumulative number of deathsduring hypothetical Covid-19-like epidemics for various non-pharmaceuticalintervention strategies. We consider local and non-local modes of diseasetransmission. The first simulates transmission through social contacts in thevicinity of the place of residence while the second through social contacts inpublic places: schools, hospitals, airports, etc., where many people meet, wholive in remote geographic locations. Epidemic spreading is modeled as adiscrete-time stochastic process on random geometric networks. We use theMonte-Carlo method in the simulations. The~following assumptions are made. Thebasic reproduction number is 2.5 and the infectious period lasts approximatelyten days. Infections lead to SARS in about one percent of cases, which arelikely to lead to respiratory default and death, unless the patient receives anappropriate medical treatment. The~healthcare system capacity is simulated bythe availability of respiratory ventilators or intensive care beds. Someparameters of the model, like mortality rates or the number of respiratoryventilators per 100000 inhabitants, are chosen to simulate the real values forthe USA and Poland. In the simulations we compare `do-nothing' strategy withmitigation strategies based on social distancing and reducing social mixing. Westudy epidemics in the pre-vaccine era, where immunity is obtained only byinfection. The model applies only to epidemics for which reinfections are rareand can be neglected. The results of the simulations show that strategies thatslow the development of an epidemic too much in the early stages do notsignificantly reduce the overall number of deaths in the long term, butincrease the duration of the epidemic. In particular, a~hybrid strategy wherelockdown is held for some time and is then completely released, is inefficient.;/abs/2006.15583

For this specific disease, theidentificato of the infected is particularly challenging since there existscathegories, namely the asymptomatics, who are positive and potentiallycontagious, but do not show any of the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2. Until thedevelopement and distribution of a vaccine is not yet ready, we need to designways of selecting those individuals which are most likely infected, given thelimited amount of tests which are available each day. In this paper, we makeuse of available data collected by the so called contact tracing apps todevelop an algorithm, namely PPTO, that identifies those individuals that aremost likely positive and, therefore, should be tested. While in the past theseanalysis have been conducted by centralized algorithms, requiring that all theapp users data are gathered in a single database, our protocol is able to workon a device level, by exploiting the communication of anonymized information toother devices.;/abs/2006.15977

A Macroeconomic SIR Model for COVID-19";(Submitted on 23 Jun 2020);Erhan Bayraktar;Asaf Cohen;April Nellis;;;The current COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have highlighted theclose and delicate relationship between a country's public health and economichealth. Macroeconomic models that use preexisting epidemic models to calculatethe impacts of a disease outbreak are therefore extremely useful forpolicymakers seeking to evaluate the best course of action in such a crisis. Wedevelop an SIR model of the COVID-19 pandemic that explicitly considers herdimmunity, behavior-dependent transmission rates, remote workers, and indirectexternalities of lockdown. This model is presented as an exit time controlproblem where lockdown ends when the population achieves herd immunity, eithernaturally or via a vaccine. A social planner prescribes separate levels oflockdown for two separate sections of the adult population: low-risk (ages20-64) and high-risk (ages 65 and over). These levels are determined viaoptimization of an objective function which assigns a macroeconomic cost to thelevel of lockdown and the number of deaths. We find that, by ending lockdownsonce herd immunity is reached, high-risk individuals are able to leave lockdownsignificantly before the arrival of a vaccine without causing large increasesin mortality. Moreover, if we incorporate a behavior-dependent transmissionrate which represents increased personal caution in response to increasedinfection levels, both output loss and total mortality are lowered. Lockdownefficacy is further increased when there is less interaction between low- andhigh-risk individuals, and increased remote work decreases output losses.Overall, our model predicts that a lockdown which ends at the arrival of herdimmunity, combined with individual actions to slow virus transmission, canreduce total mortality to one-third of the no-lockdown level, while allowinghigh-risk individuals to leave lockdown well before vaccine arrival.;/abs/2006.16389

SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA sequence classification and geographical analysis  with convolutional neural networks approach";(Submitted on 9 Jul 2020);Selcuk Yazar;;;;;Covid-19 infection, which spread to the whole world in December 2019 and isstill active, caused more than 250 thousand deaths in the world today.Researches on this subject have been focused on analyzing the genetic structureof the virus, developing vaccines, the course of the disease, and its source.In this study, RNA sequences belonging to the SARS-CoV-2 virus are transformedinto gene motifs with two basic image processing algorithms and classified withthe convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The CNN models achieved anaverage of 98% Area Under Curve(AUC) value was achieved in RNA sequencesclassified as Asia, Europe, America, and Oceania. The resulting artificialneural network model was used for phylogenetic analysis of the variant of thevirus isolated in Turkey. The classification results reached were compared withgene alignment values in the GISAID database, where SARS-CoV-2 virus recordsare kept all over the world. Our experimental results have revealed that nowthe detection of the geographic distribution of the virus with the CNN modelsmight serve as an efficient method.;/abs/2007.05055

Climate & BCG: Effects on COVID-19 Death Growth Rates";(Submitted on 10 Jul 2020);Chris Finlay;Bruce A. Bassett;;;;Multiple studies have suggested the spread of COVID-19 is affected by factorssuch as climate, BCG vaccinations, pollution and blood type. We perform a jointstudy of these factors using the death growth rates of 40 regions worldwidewith both machine learning and Bayesian methods. We find weak, non-significant(< 3$\sigma$) evidence for temperature and relative humidity as factors in thespread of COVID-19 but little or no evidence for BCG vaccination prevalence or$\text{PM}_{2.5}$ pollution. The only variable detected at a statisticallysignificant level (>3$\sigma$) is the rate of positive COVID-19 tests, withhigher positive rates correlating with higher daily growth of deaths.;/abs/2007.05542

Vaccination strategies against COVID-19 and the diffusion of  anti-vaccination views";(Submitted on 28 Sep 2020);Rafael Prieto Curiel;Humberto González Ramírez;;;;Miss-information is usually adjusted to fit distinct narratives and canpropagate rapidly through communities of interest, which work as echo chambers,cause reinforcement and foster confirmation bias. False beliefs, once adopted,are rarely corrected. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, pandemic-deniers and peoplewho oppose wearing face masks or quarantines have already been a substantialaspect of the development of the pandemic. With a potential vaccine forCOVID-19, different anti-vaccine narratives will be created and, likely,adopted by large population groups, with critical consequences. Here, weanalyse epidemic spreading and optimal vaccination strategies, measured withthe average years of life lost, in two network topologies (scale-free andsmall-world) assuming full adherence to vaccine administration. We consider thespread of anti-vaccine views in the network, using a similar diffusion model asthe one used in epidemics, which are adopted based on a persuasivenessparameter of anti-vaccine views. Results show that even if an anti-vaccinenarrative has a small persuasiveness, a large part of the population will berapidly exposed to them. Assuming that all individuals are equally likely toadopt anti-vaccine views after being exposed, more central nodes in the networkare more exposed and therefore are more likely to adopt them. Comparing yearsof life lost, anti-vaccine views could have a significant cost not only onthose who share them, since the core social benefits of a limited vaccinationstrategy (reduction of susceptible hosts, network disruptions and slowing thespread of the disease) are substantially shortened.;/abs/2009.13674

Mobility patterns of the Portuguese population during the COVID-19  pandemic";(Submitted on 2 Jul 2020 (;Tiago Tamagusko;Adelino Ferreira;;;;SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019. Since then, it has spread to severalcountries, becoming classified as a pandemic. So far, there is no definitivetreatment or vaccine, so the best solution is to prevent transmission betweenindividuals through social distancing. However, it is difficult to measure theeffectiveness of these distance measures. Therefore, this study uses data fromGoogle COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports to try to understand the mobilitypatterns of the Portuguese population during the COVID-19 pandemic. In thisstudy, the Rt value was modeled for Portugal. Also, the changepoint wascalculated for the population mobility patterns. Thus, the change in themobility pattern was used to understand the impact of social distance measureson the dissemination of COVID-19. As a result, it can be stated that theinitial Rt value in Portugal was very close to 3, falling to values close to 1after 25 days. Social isolation measures were adopted quickly. Furthermore, itwas observed that public transport was avoided during the pandemic. Finally,until the emergence of a vaccine or an effective treatment, this is the newnormal, and it must be understood that new patterns of mobility, socialinteraction, and hygiene must be adapted to this reality.;/abs/2007.06506

A Privacy Preserved and Cost Efficient Control Scheme for Coronavirus  Outbreak Using Call Data Record and Contact Tracing";(Submitted on 4 Oct 2020 (;Shibli Nisar;Syed Muhammad Ali Zuhaib;Abasin Ulasyar;Muhammad Tariq;;Coronavirus or COVID-19, which has been declared pandemic by the World HealthOrganization, has incurred huge losses to the lives of people throughout theworld. Although, the scientists, researchers and doctors are working round theclock to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, it may take a year or two to make asafe and effective vaccine available for the world. In current circumstances, asolution must be developed to control or stop the spread of the virus. For thispurpose, a novel technique based on call data record analysis (CDRA)and contacttracing is proposed that can effectively control the coronavirus outbreak. Apositive coronavirus patient can be traced through CDRA and contact tracing.The technique can track the path traversed by the patient and collect the cellnumbers of all those people who have met with the patient. Keeping in tact theprivacy of this group of people, who are contacted through their cell numbersso that they can isolate themselves till the result of their coronavirus testarrives. If a test result of a person comes positive among the group, thenhe/she must be isolated and same CDRA and contact tracing procedures areadopted for that person. A COVID-19 patient is geo tagged and alerts are sentif any violation of isolation is done by the patient. Moreover, the generalpublic is informed in advance to avoid the path followed by the patients. Thiscost effective mechanism is not only capable to control the coronavirusoutbreak but also helps in isolating the patient in his/her house.;/abs/2010.01521

Pay Attention to the cough: Early Diagnosis of COVID-19 using  Interpretable Symptoms Embeddings with Cough Sound Signal Processing";(Submitted on 6 Oct 2020 (;Ankit Pal;Malaikannan Sankarasubbu;;;;COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led toa treacherous and devastating catastrophe for humanity. At the time of writing,no specific antivirus drugs or vaccines are recommended to control infectiontransmission and spread. The current diagnosis of COVID-19 is done byReverse-Transcription Polymer Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing. However, thismethod is expensive, time-consuming, and not easily available in straitenedregions. An interpretable and COVID-19 diagnosis AI framework is devised anddeveloped based on the cough sounds features and symptoms metadata to overcomethese limitations. The proposed framework's performance was evaluated using amedical dataset containing Symptoms and Demographic data of 30000 audiosegments, 328 cough sounds from 150 patients with four cough classes (COVID-19, Asthma, Bronchitis, and Healthy). Experiments' results show that themodel captures the better and robust feature embedding to distinguish betweenCOVID-19 patient coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs with higherspecificity and accuracy of 95.04 $\pm$ 0.18% and 96.83$\pm$ 0.18%respectively, all the while maintaining interpretability.;/abs/2010.02417

Virus spread versus contact tracing: two competing contagion processes";(Submitted on 5 Oct 2020 (;Adriana Reyna-Lara;David Soriano-Paños;Sergio Gómez;Clara Granell;Joan T. Matamalas;After the blockade that many nations suffered to stop the growth of theincidence curve of COVID-19 during the first half of 2020, they face thechallenge of resuming their social and economic activity. The rapid airbornetransmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of a vaccine, calls for activecontainment measures to avoid the propagation of transmission chains. The beststrategy up to date, popularly known as Test-Track-Treat (TTT), consist intesting the population for diagnosis, track the contacts of those infected, andtreat by quarantine all these cases. The dynamical process that betterdescribes the combined action of the former mechanisms is that of a contagionprocess that competes with the spread of the pathogen, cutting off potentialcontagion pathways. Here we propose a compartmental model that couples thedynamics of the infection with the contact tracing and isolation of cases. Wedevelop an analytical expression for the effective case reproduction number$R_c(t)$ that reveals the role of contact tracing in the mitigation andsuppression of the epidemics. We show that there is a trade off between theinfection propagation and the isolation of cases. If the isolation is limitedto symptomatic individuals only, the incidence curve can be flattened but notbended. However, if contact tracing is applied to asymptomatic individuals too,the strategy can bend the curve and suppress the epidemics. Quantitativeresults are dependent on the network topology. We quantify, the most importantindicator of the effectiveness of contact tracing, namely its capacity toreverse the increasing tendency of the epidemic curve, causing its bending.;/abs/2010.01867

The risk for a new COVID-19 wave -- and how it depends on $R_0$, the  current immunity level and current restrictions";(Submitted on 9 Oct 2020);Tom Britton;Pieter Trapman;Frank Ball;;;The COVID-19 pandemic has hit different parts of the world differently: someregions are still in the rise of the first wave, other regions are now facing adecline after a first wave, and yet other regions have started to see a secondwave. The current immunity level $\hat i$ in a region is closely related to thecumulative fraction infected, which primarily depends on two factors: a) theinitial potential for COVID-19 in the region (often quantified by the basicreproduction number $R_0$), and b) the timing, amount and effectiveness ofpreventive measures put in place. By means of a mathematical model includingheterogeneities owing to age, social activity and susceptibility, and allowingfor time-varying preventive measures, the risk for a new epidemic wave and itsdoubling time, and how they depend on $R_0$, $\hat i$ and the overall effect ofthe current preventive measures, are investigated. Focus lies on quantifyingthe minimal overall effect of preventive measures $p_{Min}$ needed to prevent afuture outbreak. The first result shows that the current immunity level $\hati$ plays a more influential roll than when immunity is obtained fromvaccination. Secondly, by comparing regions with different $R_0$ and $\hat i$it is shown that regions with lower $R_0$ and low $\hat i$ may now need higherpreventive measures ($p_{Min}$) compared with other regions having higher $R_0$but also higher $\hat i$, even when such immunity levels are far from herdimmunity.;/abs/2010.04574

Prediction and mitigation of mutation threats to COVID-19 vaccines and  antibody therapies";(Submitted on 13 Oct 2020 (;Jiahui Chen;Kaifu Gao;Rui Wang;Guowei Wei;;Antibody therapeutics and vaccines are among our last resort to end theraging COVID-19 pandemic. They, however, are prone to over 5,000 mutations onthe spike (S) protein uncovered by a Mutation Tracker based on over 200,000genome isolates. It is imperative to understand how mutations would impactvaccines and antibodies in the development. In this work, we study themechanism, frequency, and ratio of mutations on the S protein. Additionally, weuse 56 antibody structures and analyze their 2D and 3D characteristics.Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes forthe complexes of S protein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics,biophysics, deep learning, and algebraic topology, we reveal that most of 462mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) will weaken the binding of Sprotein and antibodies and disrupt the efficacy and reliability of antibodytherapies and vaccines. A list of 31 vaccine escape mutants is identified,while many other disruptive mutations are detailed as well. We also unveil thatabout 65\% existing RBD mutations, including those variants recently found inthe United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa, are binding-strengthen mutations,resulting in more infectious COVID-19 variants. We discover the disparitybetween the extreme values of RBD mutation-induced BFE strengthening andweakening of the bindings with antibodies and ACE2, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2is at an advanced stage of evolution for human infection, while the humanimmune system is able to produce optimized antibodies. This discovery impliesthe vulnerability of current vaccines and antibody drugs to new mutations. Ourpredictions were validated by comparison with more than 1,400 deep mutations onthe S protein RBD. Our results show the urgent need to develop newmutation-resistant vaccines and antibodies and to prepare for seasonalvaccinations.;/abs/2010.06357

This challenge has been highlighted by theCOVID-19 pandemic, showing how viruses can quickly spread and how they canimpact society as a whole. Novel techniques that bring in different disciplinesmust emerge to provide forward-looking strategies to combat viral infections,as well as possible future pandemics. In the past decade, an interdisciplinaryarea involving bioengineering, nanotechnology and information and communicationtechnology (ICT) has been developing, known as Molecular Communications. Thisnew emerging area uses elements of classical communication systems and maps itto molecular signalling and communication found inside and outside the body,where the aim is to develop new tools that can serve future medicine. In thispaper, we provide an extensive and detailed discussion on how MolecularCommunications can be integrated into the research on viral infectious diseasesmodelling, and how possible treatment and vaccines can be developed consideringmolecules as information carriers. We provide a literature review on theexisting models of Molecular Communications for viral infection (in-body andout-body), a deep analysis on their effects on the host and subsequentcommunication process for other systems within the body (e.g., immuneresponse), sources of experimental data on known viral infections and how itcan be used by the Molecular Communications community, as well as open issuesand future directions.

Cryo-RALib -- a modular library for accelerating alignment in cryo-EM";(Submitted on 11 Nov 2020 (;Szu-Chi Chung;Cheng-Yu Hung;Huei-Lun Siao;Hung-Yi Wu;Wei-Hau Chang;Thanks to automated cryo-EM and GPU-accelerated processing, single-particlecryo-EM has become a rapid structure determination method that permits captureof dynamical structures of molecules in solution, which has been recentlydemonstrated by the determination of COVID-19 spike protein in March, shortlyafter its breakout in late January 2020. This rapidity is critical for vaccinedevelopment in response to emerging pandemic. This explains why a 2Dclassification approach based on multi-reference alignment (MRA) is not aspopular as the Bayesian-based approach despite that the former has advantage indifferentiating structural variations under low signal-to-noise ratio. This isperhaps because that MRA is a time-consuming process and a modularGPU-acceleration library for MRA is lacking. Here, we introduce a librarycalled Cryo-RALib that expands the functionality of CUDA library used by GPUISAC. It contains a GPU-accelerated MRA routine for accelerating MRA-basedclassification algorithms.

COVID-Town: An Integrated Economic-Epidemiological Agent-Based Model";(Submitted on 12 Nov 2020);Patrick Mellacher;;;;;I develop a novel macroeconomic epidemiological agent-based model to studythe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic under varying policy scenarios. Agentsdiffer with regard to their profession, family status and age and interact withother agents at home, work or during leisure activities. The model allows toimplement and test actually used or counterfactual policies such as closingschools or the leisure industry explicitly in the model in order to exploretheir impact on the spread of the virus, and their economic consequences. Themodel is calibrated with German statistical data on time use, demography,households, firm demography, employment, company profits and wages. I set up abaseline scenario based on the German containment policies and fit theepidemiological parameters of the simulation to the observed German death curveand an estimated infection curve of the first COVID-19 wave. My model suggeststhat by acting one week later, the death toll of the first wave in Germanywould have been 180% higher, whereas it would have been 60% lower, if thepolicies had been enacted a week earlier. I finally discuss two stylized fiscalpolicy scenarios: procyclical (zero-deficit) and anticyclical fiscal policy. Inthe zero-deficit scenario a vicious circle emerges, in which the economicrecession spreads from the high-interaction leisure industry to the rest of theeconomy. Even after eliminating the virus and lifting the restrictions, theeconomic recovery is incomplete. Anticyclical fiscal policy on the other handlimits the economic losses and allows for a V-shaped recovery, but does notincrease the number of deaths. These results suggest that an optimal responseto the pandemic aiming at containment or holding out for a vaccine combinesearly introduction of containment measures to keep the number of infected lowwith expansionary fiscal policy to keep output in lower risk sectors high.;/abs/2011.06289

Optimal governance and implementation of vaccination programs to contain  the COVID-19 pandemic";(Submitted on 12 Nov 2020 (;Mahendra Piraveenan;Shailendra Sawleshwarkar;Michael Walsh;Iryna Zablotska;Samit Bhattacharyya;Once a viable vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified, vaccination uptakewill determine our success in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue thatgame theory and social network models should be used to guide decisionspertaining to vaccination programs for the best possible results. In the monthsfollowing the introduction of vaccines, their availability and the humanresources needed to run the vaccination programs will likely be scarce in manycountries. Vaccine hesitancy can also be expected from some sections of thegeneral public. We emphasize that decision making under uncertainty andimperfect information, and with only conditionally optimal outcomes, is aunique forte of established game theoretic modelling. Therefore, we can usethis approach to obtain the best framework for modelling and simulatingvaccination prioritisation and uptake that will be readily available to informimportant policy decisions for the optimal control of the COVID-19 pandemic.;/abs/2011.06455

Towards a long-term control of COVID-19 at low case numbers";(Submitted on 23 Nov 2020 (;Sebastian Contreras;Jonas Dehning;Sebastian B. Mohr;F. Paul Spitzner;Viola Priesemann;The traditional long-term solutions for epidemic control involve eradicationor herd immunity. Neither of them will be attained within a few months for theCOVID-19 pandemic. Here, we analytically derive the existence of a third,viable solution: a stable equilibrium at low case numbers, wheretest-trace-and-isolate policies partially compensate for local spreadingevents, and only moderate contact restrictions remain necessary. Across wideparameter ranges of our complementary compartmental model, the equilibrium isreached at or below 10 daily new cases per million people. Such low levels hadbeen maintained over months in most European countries. However, thisequilibrium is endangered (i) if contact restrictions are relaxed, or (ii) ifcase numbers grow too high. The latter destabilisation marks a novel tippingpoint beyond which the spread self-accelerates because test-trace-and-isolatecapacities are overwhelmed. To reestablish control quickly, a lockdown isrequired. We show that a lockdown is either effective within a few weeks, ortends to fail its aim. If effective, recurring lockdowns are not necessary --contrary to the oscillating dynamics previously presented in the context ofcircuit breakers, and contrary to a regime with high case numbers -- ifmoderate contact reductions are maintained. Hence, at low case numbers, thecontrol is easier, and more freedom can be granted. We demonstrate that thisstrategy reduces case numbers and fatalities by a factor of 5 compared to astrategy focused only on avoiding major congestion of hospitals. Furthermore,our solution minimises lockdown duration, and hence economic impact. In thelong term, control will successively become easier due to immunity throughvaccination or large scale testing programmes. International coordination wouldfacilitate even more the implementation of this solution.;/abs/2011.11413

Inverted repeats in coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome and implications in  evolution";(Submitted on 24 Nov 2020);Changchuan Yin;Stephen S.-T. Yau;;;;The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the coronavirusSARS-CoV-2, has caused 60 millions of infections and 1.38 millions offatalities. Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 can provide insights on drug designand vaccine development for controlling the pandemic. Inverted repeats in agenome greatly impact the stability of the genome structure and regulate geneexpression. Inverted repeats involve cellular evolution and genetic diversity,genome arrangements, and diseases. Here, we investigate the inverted repeats inthe coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome. We found that SARS-CoV-2 genome has anabundance of inverted repeats. The inverted repeats are mainly located in thegene of the Spike protein. This result suggests the Spike protein geneundergoes recombination events, therefore, is essential for fast evolution.Comparison of the inverted repeat signatures in human and bat coronavirusessuggest that SARS-CoV-2 is mostly related SARS-related coronavirus,SARSr-CoV/RaTG13. The study also reveals that the recent SARS-relatedcoronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RmYN02, has a high amount of inverted repeats in thespike protein gene. Besides, this study demonstrates that the inverted repeatdistribution in a genome can be considered as the genomic signature. This studyhighlights the significance of inverted repeats in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2and presents the inverted repeats as the genomic signature in genome analysis.;/abs/2011.12350

Tracing the origins of SARS-CoV-2 in coronavirus phylogenies";(Submitted on 25 Nov 2020);Erwan Sallard;José Halloy;Didier Casane;Etienne Decroly;Jacques van Helden;SARS-CoV-2 is a new human coronavirus (CoV), which emerged in China in late2019 and is responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic that caused more than59 million infections and 1.4 million deaths in 11 months. Understanding theorigin of this virus is an important issue and it is necessary to determine themechanisms of its dissemination in order to contain future epidemics. Based onphylogenetic inferences, sequence analysis and structure-function relationshipsof coronavirus proteins, informed by the knowledge currently available on thevirus, we discuss the different scenarios evoked to account for the origin -natural or synthetic - of the virus. The data currently available is notsufficient to firmly assert whether SARS-CoV2 results from a zoonotic emergenceor from an accidental escape of a laboratory strain. This question needs to besolved because it has important consequences on the evaluation of risk/benefitbalance of our interaction with ecosystems, the intensive breeding of wild anddomestic animals, as well as some lab practices and on scientific policy andbiosafety regulations. Regardless of its origin, studying the evolution of themolecular mechanisms involved in the emergence of pandemic viruses is essentialto develop therapeutic and vaccine strategies and to prevent future zoonoses.This article is a translation and update of a French article published inM{\'e}decine/Sciences, Aug/Sept 2020 (;/abs/2011.12567

Fair and Diverse Allocation of Scarce Resources";(Submitted on 28 Nov 2020);Hadis Anahideh;Lulu Kang;Nazanin Nezami;;;We aim to design a fairness-aware allocation approach to maximize thegeographical diversity and avoid unfairness in the sense of demographicdisparity. During the development of this work, the COVID-19 pandemic is stillspreading in the U.S. and other parts of the world on large scale. Many poorcommunities and minority groups are much more vulnerable than the rest. Toprovide sufficient vaccine and medical resources to all residents andeffectively stop the further spreading of the pandemic, the average medicalresources per capita of a community should be independent of the community'sdemographic features but only conditional on the exposure rate to the disease.In this article, we integrate different aspects of resource allocation and seeka synergistic intervention strategy that gives vulnerable populations withhigher priority when distributing medical resources. This prevention-centeredstrategy is a trade-off between geographical coverage and social groupfairness. The proposed principle can be applied to other scarce resources andsocial benefits allocation.;/abs/2011.14198

The Vaccine Supply Chain: A Call for Resilience Analytics to Support  COVID-19 Vaccine Production and Distribution";(Submitted on 28 Nov 2020);Maureen S. Golan;Benjamin D. Trump;Jeffrey C. Cegan;Igor Linkov;;"The COVID19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of resilience in supply chains,as global networks fail from disruptions at single nodes and connections.Through an overview of the existing vaccine and pharmaceutical supply chainpublications focusing on resilience, as well as recent papers reportingmodeling of resilience in supply chains across multiple fields, we find thatmodels for supply chain resilience are few and most of them are focused onindividual dimensions of resilience rather than on comprehensive strategynecessary for scaling up vaccine production and distribution in emergencysettings. We find that COVID19 resulted in a wave of interest to supply chainresilience, but publications from 2020 are narrow in focus and largelyqualitative in nature; evidence-based models and measures are rare. Further,publications often focus exclusively on specific portions of the specificsupply chain of interest, excluding associated supporting networks, such astransportation, social and command and control (C2) necessary for vaccineproduction and equitable distribution. This lack of network analysis is a majorgap in the literature that needs to be bridged in order to create methods ofreal-time analysis and decision tools for the COVID19 vaccine supply chain. Weconclude that a comprehensive, quantitative approach to network resilience thatencompasses the supply chain in the context of other social and physicalnetworks is needed in order to address the emerging challenges of a large-scaleCOVID-19 vaccination program. We further find that the COVID-19 pandemicunderscores the necessity of positioning supply chain resilience within amulti-network context and formally incorporating temporal dimensions intoanalysis through the NAS definition of resilience, plan, absorb, recover,adapt, to ensure essential needs are met across all dimensions of society.";/abs/2011.14231

SIR Simulation of COVID-19 Pandemic in Malaysia: Will the Vaccination  Program be Effective?";(Submitted on 19 Jan 2021);W. K. Wong;Filbert H. Juwono;Tock H. Chua;;;Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 has significantly affected the lives ofpeople around the world. Towards the end of 2020, several COVID-19 vaccinecandidates with relatively high efficacy have been reported in the final phaseof clinical trials. Vaccines have been considered as critical tools for openingup social and economic activities, thereby lessening the impact of this diseaseon the society. This paper presents a simulation of COVID-19 spread usingmodified Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model under vaccine intervention inseveral localities of Malaysia, i.e. those cities or states with highrelatively COVID-19 cases such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Sabah, and Sarawak. Theresults show that at different vaccine efficacy levels (0.75, 0.85, and 0.95),the curves of active infection vary slightly, indicating that vaccines withefficacy above 0.75 would produce the herd immunity required to level thecurves. In addition, disparity is significant between implementing or notimplementing a vaccination program. Simulation results also show that loweringthe reproduction number, R0 is necessary to keep the infection curve flatdespite vaccination. This is due to the assumption that vaccination is mostlycarried out gradually at the assumed fixed rate. The statement is based on oursimulation results with two values of R0: 1.1 and 1.2, indicative of reductionof R0 by social distancing. The lower R0 shows a smaller peak amplitude abouthalf the value simulated with R0=1.2. In conclusion, the simulation modelsuggests a two-pronged strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia:vaccination and compliance with standard operating procedure issued by theWorld Health Organization (e.g. social distancing).;/abs/2101.07494

Low incidence rate of COVID-19 undermines confidence in estimation of  the vaccine efficacy";(Submitted on 25 Jan 2021 (;Yasin Memari;;;;;Knowing the true effect size of clinical interventions in randomised clinicaltrials is key to informing the public health policies. Vaccine efficacy isdefined in terms of the relative risk or the ratio of two disease risks.However, only approximate methods are available for estimating the variance ofthe relative risk. In this article, we show using a probabilistic model thatuncertainty in the efficacy rate could be underestimated when the disease riskis low. Factoring in the baseline rate of the disease, we estimate broaderconfidence intervals for the efficacy rates of the vaccines recently developedfor COVID-19. We propose new confidence intervals for the relative risk. Wefurther show that sample sizes required for phase 3 efficacy trials areroutinely underestimated and propose a new method for sample size calculationwhere the efficacy is of interest.

In this paper, we formulated amulti-objective linear programming model to optimize vaccine distribution andapplied it to the agent-based version of our age-stratified andquarantine-modified SEIR with non-linear incidence rates (ASQ-SEIR-NLIR)compartmental model. Simulations were performed using COVID-19 data from QuezonCity and results were analyzed under various scenarios: (1) no vaccination, (2)base vaccination (prioritizing essential workers and vulnerable population),(3) prioritizing mobile workforce, (4) prioritizing elderly, and (5)prioritizing mobile workforce and elderly; in terms of (a) reducing infectionrates and (b) reducing mortality incidence. After 10 simulations ondistributing 500,000 vaccine courses, results show that prioritizing mobileworkforce minimizes further infections by 24.14%, which is better than otherscenarios. On the other hand, prioritizing the elderly yields the highestprotection (439%) for the Quezon City population compared to other scenarios.This could be due to younger people, when contracted the disease, has higherchances of recovery than the elderly.

Despite much effort by scientists, medical experts, and society ingeneral, the slow progress on drug discovery and antibody therapeuticdevelopment, the unknown possible side effects of the existing vaccines, andthe high transmission rate of the SARS-CoV-2, remind us of the sad reality thatour current understanding of the transmission, infectivity, and evolution ofSARS-CoV-2 is unfortunately very limited. The major limitation is the lack ofmechanistic understanding of viral-host cell interactions, the viralregulation, protein-protein interactions, including antibody-antigen binding,protein-drug binding, host immune response, etc. This limitation will likelyhaunt the scientific community for a long time and have a devastatingconsequence in combating COVID-19 and other pathogens. Notably, compared to thelong-cycle, highly cost, and safety-demanding molecular-level experiments, thetheoretical and computational studies are economical, speedy, and easy toperform. There exists a tsunami of the literature on molecular modeling,simulation, and prediction of SARS-CoV-2 that has become impossible to fully becovered in a review.

Mainstreaming of conspiracy theories and misinformation";(Submitted on 4 Feb 2021);N.F. Johnson;N. Velasquez;N. Johnson Restrepo;R. Leahy;R. Sear;Parents - particularly moms - increasingly consult social media for supportwhen taking decisions about their young children, and likely also when advisingother family members such as elderly relatives. Minimizing malignant onlineinfluences is therefore crucial to securing their assent for policies rangingfrom vaccinations, masks and social distancing against the pandemic, tohousehold best practices against climate change, to acceptance of future 5Gtowers nearby. Here we show how a strengthening of bonds across onlinecommunities during the pandemic, has led to non-Covid-19 conspiracy theories(e.g. fluoride, chemtrails, 5G) attaining heightened access to mainstreamparent communities. Alternative health communities act as the critical conduitsbetween conspiracy theorists and parents, and make the narratives morepalatable to the latter. We demonstrate experimentally that theseinter-community bonds can perpetually generate new misinformation, irrespectiveof any changes in factual information. Our findings show explicitly whyFacebook's current policies have failed to stop the mainstreaming ofnon-Covid-19 and Covid-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation, and whytargeting the largest communities will not work. A simple yet exactly solvableand empirically grounded mathematical model, shows how modest tailoring ofmainstream communities' couplings could prevent them from tipping againstestablishment guidance. Our conclusions should also apply to other social mediaplatforms and topics.;/abs/2102.02382

Metastable states in plateaus and multi-wave epidemic dynamics of  Covid-19 spreading in Italy";(Submitted on 7 Feb 2021);Gaetano Campi;Maria Vittoria Mazziotti;Antonio Valletta;Giampietro Ravagnan;Augusto Marcelli;The control of Covid 19 epidemics by public health policy in Italy during thefirst and the second epidemic waves has been driven by using reproductivenumber Rt(t) to identify the supercritical (percolative), the subcritical(arrested), separated by the critical regime. Here we show that to quantify theCovid-19 spreading rate with containment measures (CSRwCM) there is a need of a3D expanded parameter space phase diagram built by the combination of Rt(t) anddoubling time Td(t). In this space we identify the dynamics of the Covid-19dynamics Italy and its administrative Regions. The supercritical regime ismathematically characterized by i) the power law of Td vs. [Rt(t)-1] and ii)the exponential behaviour of Td vs. time, either in the first and in the secondwave. The novel 3D phase diagram shows clearly metastable states appearingbefore and after the second wave critical regime. for loosening quarantine andtracing of actives cases. The metastable states are precursors of the abruptonset of a next nascent wave supercritical regime.

This is critical for containing the rapid spread ofCovid-19 in densely packed public locations since a single individual caninfect a large majority of people in a crowd. A vaccine credential can alsoprovide information such as an individual's Covid-19 vaccination history andadverse symptom reaction history to judge their potential impact on the overallhealth of individuals within densely packed public locations and workspaces.After completing the comparisons, we believe a card-based implementation willbenefit regions with less socioeconomic mobility, limited resources, andstagnant administrations.

Where to locate COVID-19 mass vaccination facilities?";(Submitted on 15 Feb 2021);Dimitris Bertsimas;Vassilis Digalakis Jr.;Alexander Jacquillat;Michael Lingzhi Li;Alessandro Previero;The outbreak of COVID-19 led to a record-breaking race to develop a vaccine.However, the limited vaccine capacity creates another massive challenge: how todistribute vaccines to mitigate the near-end impact of the pandemic? In theUnited States in particular, the new Biden administration is launching massvaccination sites across the country, raising the obvious question of where tolocate these clinics to maximize the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign.This paper tackles this question with a novel data-driven approach to optimizeCOVID-19 vaccine distribution. We first augment a state-of-the-artepidemiological model, called DELPHI, to capture the effects of vaccinationsand the variability in mortality rates across age groups. We then integratethis predictive model into a prescriptive model to optimize the location ofvaccination sites and subsequent vaccine allocation. The model is formulated asa bilinear, non-convex optimization model. To solve it, we propose a coordinatedescent algorithm that iterates between optimizing vaccine distribution andsimulating the dynamics of the pandemic. As compared to benchmarks based ondemographic and epidemiological information, the proposed optimization approachincreases the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign by an estimated $20\%$,saving an extra $4000$ extra lives in the United States over a three-monthperiod. The proposed solution achieves critical fairness objectives -- byreducing the death toll of the pandemic in several states without hurtingothers -- and is highly robust to uncertainties and forecast errors -- byachieving similar benefits under a vast range of perturbations.;/abs/2102.07309
