This is in contrast\\nto conventional model learning approaches, such as those based on maximum\\nlikelihood estimate, that learn a predictive model of the environment without\\nexplicitly considering the interaction of the model and the planner. We focus\\non policy gradient type of planning algorithms and derive new loss functions\\nfor model learning that incorporate how the planner uses the model.

However, this form of peer-ranking is\\nnot resistant to collusion, which could disrupt the accuracy of the mechanism.\\nThe solution is a connectivity-based regularization which exponentially rewards\\ntrusted peers, making the system resistant to collusion of up to 50 percent of\\nthe network weight.

When it comes to AI/ML for data communication\\nNetworks (AI4NETS), and despite the many attempts to turn networks into\\nlearning agents, the successful application of AI/ML in networking is limited.\\nThere is a strong resistance against AI/ML-based solutions, and a striking gap\\nbetween the extensive academic research and the actual deployments of such\\nAI/ML-based systems in operational environments.

In\\nthis positioning paper I elaborate on the most important show-stoppers in\\nAI4NETS, and present a research agenda to tackle some of these challenges,\\nenabling a natural adoption of AI/ML for networking. In particular, I focus the\\nfuture research in AI4NETS around three major pillars: (i) to make AI/ML\\nimmediately applicable in networking problems through the concepts of effective\\nlearning, turning it into a useful and reliable way to deal with complex\\ndata-driven networking problems; (ii) to boost the adoption of AI/ML at the\\nlarge scale by learning from the Internet-paradigm itself, conceiving novel\\ndistributed and hierarchical learning approaches mimicking the distributed\\ntopological principles and operation of the Internet itself; and (iii) to\\nexploit the softwarization and distribution of networks to conceive\\nAI/ML-defined Networks (AIDN), relying on the distributed generation and\\nre-usage of knowledge through novel Knowledge Delivery Networks (KDNs).\\n\\n    '}\n",

We first performed a preliminary analysis of half a million\\narchived tickets to uncover relevant features. Then, we devised the UFTR, a\\nUnified Framework for Ticket Routing using four types of features (derived from\\ntickets, groups, and their interactions). In our experiments, we implemented\\ntwo ranking models with the UFTR. Our models outperform baselines on three\\nrouting metrics. Furthermore, a post-hoc analysis reveals that this superior\\nperformance can largely be attributed to the features that capture the\\nassociations between ticket assignment and group assignment. In short, our\\nresults demonstrate that the UFTR is a superior solution to the ticket routing\\nproblem because it takes into account previously unexploited interrelationships\\nbetween the group assignment and group transfer problems.\\n\\n    '}\n",
